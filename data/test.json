The clouds and sky had an orange tint, were less defined, and the greenery below was dark and also less defined.\n\nI notice that sometimes the camera looks to fall short of accuracy in full daylight when I shoot, but then the algorithm seems to correct and the output is great.\n\nThis was not the case here, as shown in the first pic below.\n\nHOWEVER, I stumbled upon a short-term fix, which indicated to me that there is an issue that might be resolved. \n\nThat fix was to point the camera at the ground, then raise it quickly and snap a shot before it could focus and washout the picture. It was the photographer's equivalent of taking shots like a quick-drawing, Wild West cowboy in a shootout outside the saloon. Not the best scenario for making a composition, or much else.\n\nThree result was the second photo below, a pretty decent shot considering the quick, sweeping action I had to make to take it, and much truer to what my eyes saw.\n\nCan anyone steer me towards a fix so I don't have to act like a outlaw at the ok corral when I want to take pics at sunset?",

    "user_question": "I just purchased the Pixel 3a XL 3 weeks ago to replace my 2 XL and the photo quality is worse compared to it, is this normal? Everything I read online touted the superiority of the 3 camera and that they were the same ones being used in the 3a, but I was never disappointed in my 2's camera and love using it. These pics on the 3a are consistently slightly blurry and lacking in detail... I've tried all the troubleshooting options for fixing camera focus but it's not as if *where* the camera focuses is the issue--it's that the spot it is focused on is never as sharp as it was on the 2. Cleared cache, tried safe mode, etc. Quality still sucks.\n\nUnfortunately I was 2 days too late to just return it otherwise I would've had the crack in my 2's screen repaired and kept using that. Now I'm not sure if this is something I should send the phone in to have fixed under the warranty, or if I failed to understand some aspect of the 3a's camera that would explain the poor quality and I've just wasted several hundred bucks?\n\nI've taken several dozen side-by-side comparison shots and attached one to explain what I'm talking about. Obviously the 3a's is an 'acceptable' photograph and would've been great a decade ago, but it clearly looks like a downgrade in quality to me.\n\nInfo says both were taken at ƒ/1.8 and the 2 was 1/120 while the 3a was 1/125",

In the second photo that I have attached you can actually see the difference between 1x(left one) and 0.7x(right one) selfies.\nI have posted the same query on reddit and got a response from pixel team that uninstalling the updates and then reinstalling it will fix the problem but it didn't fixed it.\nSo, someone please help me out here like is it possible by any means to get that 0.7x option in the selfie camera back cause it's really good when I take group photos.",

(the app and its UI is for kids only)\n(1.2) Nubia transfer utility in Xiaomi phone did not work and ended up having garbage contacts and lots and lots of duplicates.\n(2) Why did I have Xiaomi phone?\n(2.1) Redmagic 6S Pro Android update made hotspot feature as non-working. I do have aroundish 6-10 devices relying on wifi provided by phone (5G).\n(2.2) So used Xiaomi as my phone and Nubia phone was converted to be a tab for my work-related apps like Signal,Trello,Slack,etc.\n(2.3) Xiaomi's time is over because its hardware expired. i.e. it became unreliable\n(3) Moved back to use Redmi phone around couple of monts ago.\n\nQuery\n\n(1) is the only way to set things correctly to root the system? (have avoided rooting because of the pogo i'm using).\nor\n(2) simply get the iPhone they want me to have in my company? they always buy the greatest models with everything + things one could not even imagine and try me to use it. You know that I'm THE Linux guy and using Apple's products is really big no no.\n\nAnd\n\n(1) have contacted Nubia support about the matter. Now and most likely years ago too.\n(2) 6S Pro is ending its life and thinking about the latest model 10 but if it has this thing again will convert as Apple deranged fanatic.\nHave used around 40 working hours totally to try to fix this issue. I do not have that kind of time to build me a screwdriver to do basic things.\n\nSo would like to hear you solution for this matter.  -> But if you do not understand the matter please do not start to educate me about how antimatter is created or how axions are able to bend spacetime. <- Just solutions, no smalltalk.\n\n//arl     (Ari Lemmke)\n\n----\n\nPersonal opinions\n\n(1) If a deployer of Android does this to any app of the creator of Android I would include it in the free Android license's additional sanctions/fines part, and this would be fined like 10M$ from the vendor doing this on each occation. This would fix the matter easily. Money is always the fixer.\n(2) Google Phone app when installed would take over the phone --force because the intention to install this app is to use it. More iron wire for you to bend. (local saying how to handle persons not capable to understand).\n\nAttachments\n\n(1) App info for Google Phone\n(2) Notification setting for the Google Phone (see it is disabled)\n(3) Google Play automatic answer for the matter. Have seen it like 10 times when modified my review.\n\nPS.\n\nToday the phone rang once. But the phone app did not pop up nor anything on the notification area. Needed to start manually phone app to response incoming call.\n\nWill post this matter to LinkedIn too because have had my problems with Google: deleting accounts, removing comments.",

I have reset all my Bluetooth connections and it still persists. Bluetooth is unusable right now as the only solution is to disable Bluetooth. It is EXTREMELY frustrating that I cannot disable connection requests, turn off notifications for Bluetooth or have a selection option to block connection requests from this device. How are they even able to try and auto connect to my device in the first place? This seems like a massive security issue if random Bluetooth devices can spam me for connections.",

Then, when I go to log in to Outlook app, I get an error message that says I need to choose a higher level of security in order to log into the MS Exchange authentication process.  However, no security certificates get presented... as if a popup is being blocked.  My company says it's a known issue with Google Pixel phones.  They say the app developer Airwatch is aware.

Switch app background battery usage from \"Optimizing\" to \"Not Optimized\"\n1. Try a variety of apps. They all exhibit these symptoms.\n\nUnanswered mysteries:\n\n1. How does \"Adaptive Battery\" (settings/battery/adaptive battery) interact with \"Not Optimizing\" background battery? (Settings/Apps & Settings/*App name*/Advanced/Battery/Battery Optimization)\n1. If I whitelist an app in Background Battery  usage, will it still get stopped by Adaptive Battery?\n1. Can gaps in location data be caused by an unreliable GPS signal? (For example, between city buildings, or in a forested area).\n\nMy next steps:\n\n1. Test apps in optimal GPS conditions (clear sky, no trees, etc.)\n1. Test each app systematically\n1. Test apps with adaptive battery turned off\n1. Test apps with all battery optimization turned off in developer settings\n\nExamples of some apps being tried: GPSlogger, OSMAnd+, Hiking Project, MTB Project, Open Tracks, GaiaGPS\n\nPlease let me know if you know how any of this works, or have suggestions for what to try.

I've tried all the things I know of to calibrate things, enable all location assistance features, etc.  I called Google help and they were no help at all - they just suggtested clearing all app settings and reverting to an older version of the maps app, neither of which did anything except inconvenience me a lot.  What else could I try?  I'm trying to figure out if there is actually something broken in the phone, or if there is some way I can convince it to have proper location accuracy.

It occurs randomly but when it does I can't seem to connect to certain services when on Wifi. I first noticed with Google messages for Web, that I would suddenly get the not connected message, then I noticed it was affecting things like Gemini, and Google Drive, And Updates. Anytime I have to check something.  I have included screen shots of the messages.  I factory reset my phone hoping that would help, but it didn't. I updated my router settings, I tried 2.4 instead 5 on the router. Didn't make a difference.  My router is working fine for everything else on it.  The only thing that I did notice was that when the error was occurring if I switched off the wifi and let mobile data take over it was fine and I could connect to whatever service I was trying to reach.  I contacted support and they just wanted me to bring to the service center, I can do that, but how can they fix it? It is a know bug? I don' want to factory reset again. That was a PITA.  Anyway, if anyone has any thoughts. I've been dealing with this for a while trying everything I could think of.  See screen shots for error messages.  With any of these, when I switched to mobile they went through fine.",

I have received another update and installed it, however, the problem still persists. It changed the version to 14_C.10.\n\n2. when I click on any link which refers to an app, the option of \"always\" remains disabled. Moreover, the app icon is showing twice e.g, if I click on a news to open its link which refers to Chrome, two Chorme icon appears and the option of clicking \"always\" is disabled.\n\n3. Another issue I am facing is when ever I click on a link which is supposed to open another app e.g. Chrome, the Chrome app icon is shown double and the option of \"Always\" is disable and I am forced to choose \"just once\" repeatedly. \n\n4. The phone has got very slower after the update and the battery drains a little faster. \n\nI am from Pakistan and I  have sent an email to Realme support. They say this problem belongs to Android Software update. Few snapshots are attached.\n\nPlease help.",

However, interestingly, I have a Motorola G Pure running Android 13 as well on the same exact service provider (TracFone/Safelink on the Verizon network) which does not exhibit this bug and in turn has 0% idle battery drain within an 8 hour period.\n\nNote, disabling imsService is not an option as it is crucial for connectivity.\n\n^ (Under Location -> See all -> Three dot menu -> Show system)\n\n\n^ (Under Privacy -> Privacy dashboard -> Location -> Three dot menu -> Show system)\n\nI've tried everything seemingly possible (without root access) to alleviate this issue, short of a factory reset, some of which includes but is not limited to: Enabling/disabling adaptive connectivity; Find my device; VoLTE services; Mobile data; WiFi data; Wifi calling; Emergency alerts; Messenger chat features; Automatically select network; Allow 2g; Roaming; Resetting my network settings; Even turning on airplane mode doesn't stop imsService from requesting Location data.\n\nThe only thing I've found that will stop imsService from requesting location data is to either remove or turn off the SIM card via the settings.\n\nFor further reference, I have the latest Android patch for December 2022 and all of my system apps are up to date in the Play Store as well.\n\nAny and all help would be appreciated.

    "user_question": "I updated my phone and ever since the battery has lasted between 4-6 hours, depending on use. It gets hot after 5-10 minutes of on time, and randomly shuts down while in use when the battery gets lower (below maybe 30%). The battery is also not charging consistently, except from my google charging block. Charge cuts in and out when using an external power block or non-google wall charger. Immediately prior to the update I did not have any of these issues, and the battery life was *at least* 3-4 times better. I.e. I could use my phone heavily all day and not run out of battery.\n\nThis all occurred after I updated my phone, with what I now understand to have been a problematic update. I did the update right before leaving Canada for a trip. Is the fact that I'm in France stopping me from getting the patch that was apparently pushed through? \n\nThis battery drain is occurring even in airplane mode. I've updated everything available to me via system updates and play store. Please help.\n\nAlso see below screenshot of my battery usage, which is maybe not accurately capturing the battery? There is no app usage data despite my browser use for about an hour. The diagram also shows the battery at 75%, whereas the bar in the top right corner says 49%.",

Recently, I noticed that the side panel of the device has started to separate, as clearly shown in the attached photo. Upon closer inspection, it appears the battery may be swelling, posing a significant safety risk including the potential for explosion or fire.\n\nGiven the premium price of this device and the expectations associated with the Google brand, I am extremely disappointed. This is not just a matter of product reliability but a potential hazard to personal safety.\n\nI request the following:\n1. An immediate investigation into this issue.\n2. A full replacement or reimbursement for the device.\n3. Assurance that this complaint is being treated with the urgency it deserves due to the safety implications.\n\nPlease let me know the next steps and how I can return the defective unit for inspection or refund. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of this matter.",

When I click this, it takes me to the 'Find My Device' settings page, where I can see 'Use Find My Device' is already enabled.\n\nI have tried disabling, rebooting, re-enabling. I have tried clearing data and cache. The issue persists. And I cannot see the Chipolo in the app either.",

    "user_question": "Hello, I've been trying to use Find My Device, particularly with my new Moto Tag. When I try and pair it, my phone promps me to \"Turn On Find My Device\".... But it is on. Toggling it does nothing. But because it still is waiting for the feature to turn on, I can never add any devices to the Find My Device network. The big thing I'd like to point to in the screenshot is the big salmon colored Turn On My Device notification. I can never get it to go away, whether the feature is on or not. My wife, also with a Pixel 7, does not have that notification when Find My Device is toggled on.\n\nHelp!",

    "user_question": "Hi,\nthe trackers compatible with Find My Device network are not performing well due to the absurd default setting that Google selected.\nInstead of working on the FMD network everywhere and anytime, it works only if it's is a high traffic area of Android phones. It makes harder to track the tag in areas with not so high traffic, most of the areas.\n\nAs Apple always did, Google should immediately switch to the ALWAYS ON tracking mode as default option.\nOtherwise the trackers will be quite useless..",
