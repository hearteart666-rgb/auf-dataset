I've tried everything that's been recommended to get this to stop, I've toggled on and off filters, retouching, auto hd and AI assist, hi res, but it still does it no matter what I turn off or on. Sometimes it looks okay or is unnoticeable, but often it makes a world of difference, and I cant figure out a way to undo it on the photos I have taken, which especially disheartening when the angle shift is quite drastic especially on closeups, or a way to get it to stop making it impossible to take the photos that I want to.",

It was still off at 930am when it is supposed to turn off at 6am). AND the more frustrating thing is that for some reason all the alarms in my Clock app are reset and ALL toggle off, which means my alarm doesn't go off!!  This just started in the last week and I don't know what is causing this.  The only thing I had done prior to this change is go to Bedtime routine in the Clock app and click to start a routine but then go back.  I have also cleared the cache and storage of the Clock app, but it doesn't seem to be working.  I also have a pixel watch and had set up a separate alarm and that worked but when I synced alarms across phone and watch, it is no longer working again and has overridden all my alarms. Please help!!!  This is incredibly frustrating to have to rely on a bunch of other devices now to wake me up.",

If they send me an individual SMS message, it comes through DND fine, but the same person sending a message in a group text, does not notify me. I know for sure it used to work this way, because I oversee the IT systems at several hospitals and my team texts the whole group when we have outages. They used to wake me up, now they don't, and I changed nothing with the settings. I tried several troubleshooting options and tested on my husband's S23 as well. I even tried switching from Google Messages to Samsung Messages and nothing resolves this issue. I tried with RCS on and off. Nothing seems to fix it. \n\nFor reference, I am using the top part of the \"Calls and Messages\" exceptions to put the people that should break through DND if they call or message. I use favorite people to only break through if they call. (My family texts at all hours of the night in a different time zone, so they only break through if the call).",

All of those 100+ installed apps ask permissions again. Are you really sure one needs to build your house again because your stowe does not work?\n\n(2) reinstalled Google Phone again and again.\n\n(3) between all cycles (1) and (2) rebooted my phone.\n\nBackground / The long history of various things\n\n(1) Installed Google Phone for this Nubia phone instead of its default Telephone app.\nWhy?\n(1.1) I'm not a 12 year old kid. (the app and its UI is for kids only)\n(1.2) Nubia transfer utility in Xiaomi phone did not work and ended up having garbage contacts and lots and lots of duplicates.\n(2) Why did I have Xiaomi phone?\n(2.1) Redmagic 6S Pro Android update made hotspot feature as non-working. I do have aroundish 6-10 devices relying on wifi provided by phone (5G).\n(2.2) So used Xiaomi as my phone and Nubia phone was converted to be a tab for my work-related apps like Signal,Trello,Slack,etc.\n(2.3) Xiaomi's time is over because its hardware expired. i.e. it became unreliable\n(3) Moved back to use Redmi phone around couple of monts ago.\n\nQuery\n\n(1) is the only way to set things correctly to root the system? (have avoided rooting because of the pogo i'm using).\nor\n(2) simply get the iPhone they want me to have in my company? they always buy the greatest models with everything + things one could not even imagine and try me to use it. You know that I'm THE Linux guy and using Apple's products is really big no no.\n\nAnd\n\n(1) have contacted Nubia support about the matter. Now and most likely years ago too.\n(2) 6S Pro is ending its life and thinking about the latest model 10 but if it has this thing again will convert as Apple deranged fanatic.\nHave used around 40 working hours totally to try to fix this issue. I do not have that kind of time to build me a screwdriver to do basic things.\n\nSo would like to hear you solution for this matter.  -> But if you do not understand the matter please do not start to educate me about how antimatter is created or how axions are able to bend spacetime. <- Just solutions, no smalltalk.\n\n//arl     (Ari Lemmke)\n\n----\n\nPersonal opinions\n\n(1) If a deployer of Android does this to any app of the creator of Android I would include it in the free Android license's additional sanctions/fines part, and this would be fined like 10M$ from the vendor doing this on each occation. This would fix the matter easily. Money is always the fixer.\n(2) Google Phone app when installed would take over the phone --force because the intention to install this app is to use it. More iron wire for you to bend. (local saying how to handle persons not capable to understand).\n\nAttachments\n\n(1) App info for Google Phone\n(2) Notification setting for the Google Phone (see it is disabled)\n(3) Google Play automatic answer for the matter. Have seen it like 10 times when modified my review.\n\nPS.\n\nToday the phone rang once. But the phone app did not pop up nor anything on the notification area. Needed to start manually phone app to response incoming call.\n\nWill post this matter to LinkedIn too because have had my problems with Google: deleting accounts, removing comments.",

I would like to explain the situation in detail:\n\n- My device is a **Redmi 12 5G** with the model number **23077RABDC** running the official global ROM (**MIUI 14.0.4 TMWMIXM**, Android 13).\n- I recently registered my device using the **Google Services Framework (GSF) ID**, and when I try to register it again, the message says: **\"This ID has already been registered\"**.\n- However, when I go to **Google Play Store > Settings > About**, it still shows that the **device is not certified**.\n- When I try to follow the suggested fix under “Fix device certification”, a new screen appears with the message: **\"To fix this device, you need to lock the bootloader.\"**\n- Additionally, when I check my devices under my Google account, I notice that my device appears **twice**:\n   - Once as **Redmi 12 5G**\n  And once as **Redmi 2307****C**\n- In the Google Account settings on the phone itself, it appears as **Redmi 12 5G**.\n\nI have not rooted or modified the device in any way, and everything is stock. I would appreciate it if you could check this issue from your side and confirm why the device is still showing as uncertified despite being previously registered.\n\nI am looking forward to your help to resolve this issue so I can fully use Google apps and services, including WhatsApp and Google Play.\n\nThank you very much for your time and support.\n\nBest regards,  \n**Mohammed Ali**  \n(Yemen)",

    "user_question": "I've never had an issue with Android updates before, but my phone auto-installed the update to Android 14 today. I haven't even had Android 14 for a day and I already HATE it. \n\nFor context, I've only had Samsung Galaxy phones since the S4 Active came out. I'm currently using a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, and my previous was the Note 20 Ultra. Prior to having the Note 20 Ultra, I've either had the S(#) Active series phones or Note phones.\n\nMy main issue right now is with the navigation bar and 3-button navigation in Android 14. What ever happened to \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it?\" It used to be that I could choose from having \"permanent\" buttons on the bottom of the screen for 3-button navigation, or swipe for 3-button navigation, where swiping up from the bottom of my screen in the center would act as the home button, swiping up from the left side would act as the overview button, and swiping up from the right side would act as the back button.\n\nNow with Android 14, for whatever dumb reason, the only options are to have the \"permanent\" buttons, or a single center swipe up for home. It's now changed the back swipe to swiping in from either the left or right sides of the phone toward the center, and I have yet to find out how to bring up the overview with this new update. The change to the swipe feature with the navigation bar is frustrating because not only is it NOT intuitive, it's also bothersome and has undone YEARS of muscle memory in using swipe for 3-button navigation. Additionally, it feels as though Android 14 is trying to copy Apple now with this new swipe-from-the-side back swipe gesture (I also have an iPhone 12 Pro Max that I've used for work since that model came out, and it is so annoying and buggy and truly serves as a constant reminder for why I use Android for my personal phone).\n\nOn top of that, I've never had an issue with using swipe on the navigation bar to get to one-handed mode until today when this blasted update took over. Now, even with the setting for one-handed mode being the same as I've had it for literal years, it's not working in Android 14. When I try it now in Android 14, it seems to only want to offer some AI assistant that I didn't ask for and so far haven't found a way to disable in the settings. This, despite my settings for one-handed mode being the same on every model of phone I've had that allowed for it.\n\nIt is mind-boggling how they would make this drastic change in Android 14 while also not allowing the option to have the \"old\" swipe for 3-button navigation. I've personally never liked having the \"permanent\" buttons on a touch screen because it feels clunky to use and constantly takes up space on the bottom of the screen; 3-button navigation swipe also just feels so much better to use.\n\nOnce I discovered this dumb change in Android 14, I immediately started looking for ways and workarounds to get the old navigation bar back, but all I've found so far is an article saying I need to download a certain app and allow a certain option in order to get it back. I'm hesitant to do so because I did something similar for a keyboard issue on the Note 20 Ultra and ended up getting adware after downloading a third party app; however, if it means I can use my phone again the way I've been using it for LITERAL YEARS, it might be worth the risk.\n\nOverall, Android 14 is annoying and already feels like a letdown and a rip-off. I truly don't even care about what \"new and exciting\" features it has when it makes it so frustrating to even use my phone.  I'd rather go back to Android 13 where I can use my phone the way I have been for YEARS without needing to download any third party apps just to use something as basic as the navigation bar.\n\nAdding screenshots:",

I contacted support and they just wanted me to bring to the service center, I can do that, but how can they fix it? It is a know bug? I don' want to factory reset again. That was a PITA.

    "user_question": "I have a pixel 8 running the latest version of Android 15. Recently after the last update my phone is constantly spammed by notifications to pair with devices I have never paired with before. The devices range in name. Some are obviously different speakers I do not own, sometimes it is a device called null or something else. I have not paired with them before. I have reset all my Bluetooth connections and it still persists. Bluetooth is unusable right now as the only solution is to disable Bluetooth. It is EXTREMELY frustrating that I cannot disable connection requests, turn off notifications for Bluetooth or have a selection option to block connection requests from this device. How are they even able to try and auto connect to my device in the first place? This seems like a massive security issue if random Bluetooth devices can spam me for connections.",

    "user_question": "📨 \nHello Google,\n\nI am writing to formally escalate a serious issue affecting my Pixel 9a since the Android 16 update, which I downloaded on June 22nd. Since then, both cellular connectivity and Wi-Fi have become virtually unusable, with persistent instability and data speeds frequently below 1 Mbps. This renders the device fundamentally incapable of performing essential functions.\nI have executed all standard troubleshooting steps:\nFull device restart\nNetwork settings reset\nManual switching between 4G, 5G, and Wi-Fi\nDNS modifications\nNone of these actions have resolved the issue.\nThis is not an isolated case. Numerous Pixel users have publicly reported identical symptoms, indicating a systemic fault—either within the Exynos 5300 modem or Android 16’s handling of it. Yet, despite weeks of user feedback, Google has only acknowledged the issue without providing any viable solution or timeline for resolution.\nAccording to Google’s own warranty terms, a software update that renders the device unusable is grounds for warranty action. Additionally, in Norway, consumer rights are especially robust: mobile devices must function as intended for up to five years. When a manufacturer releases an update that disables critical functions, this constitutes a breach of consumer law.\nI find it unacceptable that Google has not prioritized this issue with urgency. A vague promise that “a fix is coming” is insufficient when the device fails to perform basic connectivity tasks nearly a month after the update.\nTherefore, I formally request:\nImmediate escalation to the engineering and warranty team\nA commitment to a concrete timeline for correction\nOr an offer of repair, refund, or replacement\nIf Google is unable to address this proactively, I will pursue resolution under Norwegian consumer protection law. \n\nFirst pic: WiFi\nSec  pic: 5G",

So the problem occurs when at that point, you press the button to turn off bluetooth the device restarts. I couldn't find anything about a problem like this anywhere else, because I can still connect to bluetooth. This happens regardless of whether I connect a device, but the only one I use is a Galaxy Buds 2.",

I’ve tried to reinstall the Spotify app, update the app or even Android Auto app. I also reset the bluetooth connection with my car without results. Then tried to reset Bluetooth and Wi Fi settings. Nothing worked out. I think it’s a Bluetooth related issue because when I’m connecting the Pixel 9 Pro XL by wire and via Android Auto everything is working fine and album artwork is being displayed in spotify. I also noticed that sometimes the album photo is recognized and displayed only for the 1st song. Then when the next song comes it disappears. I have also to say that I have another mobile Android device (Samsung Galaxy S21) and it works perfect without any problems in the same auto. This shows that rather the problem is on Pixel side. I have the latest update of November installed in my Pixel device but still the issue remains. Can you please help? Are you aware of this problem? from other users? In the pictures attached, you can see respectively 1. the missing album's photo and song's duration (connection via Bluetooth with Pixel 9 Pro XL), 2. the picture is recognized via wired Android Auto connection with Pixel, 3.

    "user_question": "Ever since the last major system update (circa 4-5 July), my pixel 8, purchased in January 2024, started prompting 'system process isn't responding' and asks me if I would wait or close the app. The thing is it doesn't say which app and the prompt goes away when I tap on either option. The strange thing too is my battery started draining very rapidly, going from fully charged to less than 50% with 1 minute screen time. I got issues another device via RMA and the issue is back. It seems like it's a software related issue that occurs after I restore phone settings from my backup via Google 1. The issue seems to go away while I'm in safe mode, so I'm pretty certain it has something to do with an app? I have deleted many third party apps, however I never had this issue with any of the apps prior to the update in early July. Has anyone else had the same issue? I have also done a factory reset but the issue starts after I have restored my data from Google 1. Screenshots below is evidence. The weird thing is that I don't have this issue on my pixel 5 which I had to use after sending the original device back for the RMA. It obviously used all the same apps and device settings as the pixel 8. Any tips, advice would be great. I'd be hesitant to lodge another RMA as I expect the same issue to happen again. Plus the process is highly disruptive to my ability to use a device on a day to day.",

    "user_question": "I know there are multiple topics about this issue, but, I wanted to add to the fire.\n\nMy battery life since Android 11 has been absolutely terrible. I used to average around 1 day and 5 hours on a charge, now, from what the system says, it lasts 16 hours. Actual time that it lasts is significantly less. Yesterday I unplugged around 10am, and was at 15% by 830pm, with 3 hours of screen time. Some days depending on what I'm doing, I will have to charge before going to work. Terrible.\n\nI use the stock google charger and cable, I have minimal apps on my phone, I would say the most intensive thing that I do with my phone is streaming music.\n\nDuring the A11 beta, there were a few builds where I would be able to get 5/6 hours of screen time with one charge, not the case anymore. \n\nI feel like the overall performance and feel of the device since A11 is significantly reduced, camera lags, keyboard lags, apps lag to load. Very disappointed with how A11 has been so far.\n\nBattery drain is excessive aswell, if I unplug at a full battery and it sit over night, it will drain a minimum of 15%, also terrible, precious builds used to have a max drain of 5/6%.\n\nFeedback is appreciated, solutions would be greatly appreciated.",

I will use a secure, trusted reputable site that will allow anyone to follow along/ repeat what I'm doing safely and easily. I will use the UK (I'm from UK) Government website:\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-windsor-framework\n\nThis website has a series of download links which are embedded into text, shown as blue text in the Google Go app:\n\n\nWhen you press on one of these embedded download links, it gets highlighted yellow, and Google Go brings up a prompt at the bottom of the screen to confirm the download:\n\n\nThis is a new feature for Google apps as usually it is an automatic download. I like this new feature and think it will save me from lots of accidental downloads. However, wherever I try to press or hold down on this download button nothing actually happens.\n \nThe button will register that I have pressed it by flashing grey, or by turning and remaining grey whilst I am continuously pressing down the button before turning white again when the button is released, but will never actually download anything. Tapping anywhere else on the page will just cause the download prompt to disappear, and tapping on the icon or name of the file on the prompt will do nothing.\n\nIf anyone else has come across this or has knowledge in this area, I'd be grateful for any help.

    "user_question": "I postponed the November 1 patch until today. As soon as the updates installed, ALL of my fonts across RANDOM apps, ALL browsers and my UI went to the smallest font size. \n\nMy UI font size will no longer adjust properly. It's almost like it's stuck at the halfway size (even though it's set to full zoom). This wasn't like this before.\n\nMy phone's font inside the settings menu will properly adjust, but this only works in the settings menu and in my web browser URL window for Opera.\n\nI can adjust text scaling in my Opera browser, but it only works in search results, not websites. This gives me three different font sizes when searching (URL window, search bar, search results).\n\nChrome is the opposite. Text scaling doesn't work in browser results or the URL window, but does work on websites.\n\nMost of my apps have very small images and font as well. My words with friends picture shows how small everything is and I can't make it normal again. Compare that font with my status bar. This is across random apps.\n\nNo changes were made at my end. This happened upon the auto restart from the update. \n\nI've tried restarting my phone and adjusting everything related to zoom and font size on my phone and in apps, but none of this is working except the settings menu and url window. I need reading glasses and had everything set where I didn't need them. Now I can't use my phone without my glasses! Plus nothing fits to size (even with force zoom and text wrap on or off).\n\nAnyone else having this issue?\nSamsung Galaxy S21 Ultra",

The \"Apps from Unknown Sources\" toggle is selected in Family Link, but I can't install an app from an apk file on the Pixel 5- I get a \"can't install\" popup.\n\nThe install unknown apps options are greyed out in the settings on the Pixel 5.  If I try to change these, I get the popup message \"Parent needed - Hand the phone to your parent to allow this setting to be changed\", but the only option available in the popup is \"close\" - nothing for me to be able to authorise anything.\n\nI'm at a loss to know what to try.\n\nThis is a really annoying problem.",

I have tried posting stories and blogs with my pictures and videos, but the app says that they don't have access. I already went to settings to change the permissions from \"don't allow\" to \"allow\". But the thing is that there are no options for me to change for the permissions to use my photos or videos. I just have permission to allow the app to use my microphone and that's it. Like literally that is the only thing that shows up under the permissions section and nothing else. I tried restarting my phone and then resetting all of my apps preferences and still it stays the same. When I click on Apps and I click on \"wit\", it won't give me the option to give permission to use my photos or videos because that option button doesn't show up. I have tried everything I could. Can I please get some help or maybe advice as to what may be happening with my phone or what is going on. Is it the new phone update? I haven't had any difficulty with giving this certain app any permissions until after I updated it to Android 13. I really need help.",

It's a systemic rendering flaw that affects every app and interface, making Lao script appear broken or unreadable. Lao relies on distinctive marks for legibility, and the current font omits these entirely.\n\n📍 This impacts native Lao speakers, but also the sizable Lao diaspora in the U.S. and abroad, many of whom rely on Android devices for staying connected to their language and heritage.\n\nIt’s an accessibility failure and a clear case of marginalised language users being overlooked in system-level design. Android claims global inclusivity — this issue contradicts that.\n\n🔧 The system should default to or at least support a script-appropriate font like Noto Serif Lao, which preserves all essential glyphs. Alternatively, users should be allowed to override system fonts for scripts like Lao.\n\nPlease help 😞😣\n\nDevice: Pixel 8\n\nAndroid Version: 15\n\nIssue: System-wide Lao script rendering failure due to inappropriate default font\n\nScreenshot attached of Lao vs Thai (which was fixed) and actual Lao script",

However, this process is time-consuming as it requires modifying each photo individually.\nWhile resolving this issue, I also discovered a minor bug when using Google Maps on Win10. The same GPS coordinates display with a slight deviation on different layers, coinciding with the offset in the photo's location on the map.\nI wanted to report this issue to you in the hope of receiving some assistance. Could it be a problem with the GPS information acquired by the Google Camera, or is there a bug in the display layers? Additionally, I'm curious if there's a more streamlined method for batch-editing photo information to address this location discrepancy.",

The bedside cabinet where the phone was charging is charred, as is the carpet where the phone was spitting white hot debris. The phone itself is obviously toast.\n\nI was fortunate that I was there when it happened and caught it in time - my wife and two kids slept through, until I woke them to get them out the house while the smoke cleared. The house now stinks, there's a clawing, acrid chemical smell in everything.\n\nI'd like to contact Google to let them know that this has happened, in case there's a manufacturing/battery fault that could affect other Pixel 5 owners. I would, obviously, also like to think there was some sort of warranty cover for the phone and damage done, but it looks like Google only offer 2 years warranty in the UK. I'd like to think this was an exception, though.\n\nIs there a specific process to follow to report this?\n\nMany thanks for your thoughts!",

Google support provides instructions for doing this (attached below) but there is no 'Share' option in the Find my Device app.  Does anyone know if this is possible, i.e. being able to share your device to someone else on Find My Device.\n\nSeems pretty useless if you can't share this ability. If you have lost your own phone, you need to be able to use Find my Device on another phone.  So sharing would seem pretty important.  If you lose your phone, it's very difficult to login into your google account on another phone if you are using MFA.\n\nApple seems to make these types of things much more straightforward.

It means I cannot wireless charge or fast charge unless I keep my phone in the fridge for a few minutes which is kinda funny. \nPlease investigate this issue and fix it as it makes using the Pixel a terrible experience.\nI have to mention that I already did a factory reset because of this issue. I wiped everything and started from scratch, but it still overheats no matter what.",

    "user_question": "...from Settings/Security & Privacy/More security settings/Theft Protection.\n-----\nUPDATE 29/3/2025:\nTLDR: removing Google account from the phone and then signing back into it immediately fixed the problem. What a waste of everybody's time.\n\nMore details: I removed (i.e. signed out) my Google account on my A25 5G (for other reasons) and then I signed back in. After 10 minutes I noticed that the Remote Lock option has reappeared - and works (tested from the website). I later repeated for my partner's A25 5G and it immediately showed the Remote Lock. On my phone the ASKS security software has changed from version 20230714 to 20240926 but my partner's phone already had that, so it's possibly irrelevant.\n-----\nRemote Lock was there, then it wasn't when I checked again. [irrelevant now: My partner's identical phone has it still]. I restarted mine, didn't fix the issue. [irrelevant now: All our security setting are the same. I note that the ASKS software release date is different, and this is allegedly related to theft protection functions. Specifically, it's ASKS v8.4 is Release 20240926 on my partner's, and 20230714 on mine]. But why was Remote Lock there and then not? Why do two identical phones have different ASKS software releases?\n\nEdit: partner's phone also lost Remote Lock after a few more hours.\n\nEdit 2: Samsung have confirmed that they don't know why but they too have Android 14 One UI 6.1 devices that also have a missing Remote Lock option, plus it is there on Android 15 One UI 7 devices. There is a suspicion that Google's removed it, perhaps temporarily.\n\nEdit 3: Several Samsung community members also report this issue.",

The found tracker belonged to my father, but strangely it was in the house the whole time, never came with me on my journey, although the map shows that it did.\nMy father has another air tag, which is probably the unfound tracker, but I do have reason to believe that a former friend has the means motive and opportunity to track me and I have already had to factory reset my phone to clear spyware he previously installed.

I could contact the phone, I could send rings to it, but it wasn’t where find my device said it was. As I couldn’t find it, I then sent a secure device request to the phone to which find my device in a browser on my other phone, an iPhone 15 Pro Max said was done. When I eventually found the phone, it did say that the device was locked by the administrator, but what I found was my Google account was not signed out nor were any cards removed from my Google wallet. Since then, I have replicated this problem multiple times. With the phone sitting next to me, I have sent secure device command multiple times. Each time the phone says it’s been locked, but it never signs me out of my account nor does it remove any cards from Google wallet. This seems to be a huge security vulnerability of my android device \n\nIf I cannot trust that find my device will do what it’s supposed to do that will be the last of my days with an Android phone. \n\nMaybe the question is, how many of you have actually tested the security & reliability of Find My device?",

I'm encountering this issue when trying to download X (Twitter), Amazon Shopping, Bumble, Countdown widget...etc \n\nI've already raised this with Google's support team unfortunately, none of their replies have been helpful so far. So kindly refrain from commenting any of the following answers, I'm seeking an actual solution for this annoying problem: \n\n1. Share generic feedback (all steps were done and the issue is still persisting).\n\nCheck if you’re signed in to the correct Google Account.\nOpen the Play Store. At the top right, select the profile icon.\nIf you’re not signed in to the correct account, switch accounts and try again.\nUpdate the time.\nOn your device, turn off Automatic date and time. Then, turn it back on.\nCheck software and system updates on your device.\nTo check if an update is available, go to the software or system updates in your settings.\nIf an update is available, update your device.\nCheck that you have a strong Wi-Fi or mobile data connection. \nIt’s best if you can connect to a Wi-Fi network.\nIf you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, make sure that you have a strong mobile data connection.\nTry your download again.\nTo get more help with connection problems on Android devices, go to Fix Internet connection problems on Android devices.\nCheck if there are any issues with your payment profile.\n\n 2. Request to perform a FDR: Reset your Android device to factory settings.\n\n3. Request to contact the device manufacturer.\n\nCheers!",

I cannot even Google search without crashing but every app, aside from Google's own, work no problem. \n\nI think it's important to note that \nA) it runs official Samsung firmware always, anything updated, is always done through OTA.\nB) in no way, shape or form was any system partition ever touched. \nC)Maybe the most important, this JUST started a few days ago when I noticed any browser I had that was using web view, immediately locked up and phone is nearly unusable.\nThe Play Store also will not give me a diagnosis for why I'm failing, nor will it \"fix it now\" when pressed. I'm at a complete loss for words.\nWhy is my totally unmodified flagship phone showing \"not certified\" in the play store??",

    "user_question": "So I have a SM-S928U1 that is never had an issue since I bought it on launch day last year. To make a long story short, this second this phone received and booted OneUI 7, it immediately, and for absolutely no reason, fails Attestation rendering my phone a modern Huawei equivalent. No Google services work on my phone whatsoever. Chrome doesn't even work on my phone without force crashing within the first 30 seconds or so of using it. WebView in general breaks constantly, lost all RCS access, Google Feed access, the Google app literally cannot be opened leading to the feed disappearing. \nFunny enough, Gemini advanced and all other variants work perfectly fine, Google one works perfectly fine, all third party safety net checkers report a strong pass (meets strong device integrity) however the few newly updated Play Integrity API apps since SafetyNet now has consolidated under the Play Integrity API umbrella, report a fail just like the play store itself yet are unable to produce any reason for the failure.\nI'm currently the sole person with an S24 Ultra not passing integrity checks after two firmware updates now of OneUI 7. Nobody wants to even bother looking into this because I'm 1 person, however if my (at the time of purchase) $1540 \"flagship\", that has widely been known for having a physically impossible to unlock bootloader or gain root access for many years now, can just be rendered both useless to me and also valueless on the market without any Google services, again, FOR NO REASON, I believe that gives me a strong case against Samsung, Google or whoever's actually at fault but refusing to acknowledge or fix my phone. I'm quite adept with electronics, I was one of the known names on XDA back when phones were fully owned by us. I haven't touched a system partition since the Galaxy S8+. My S24 Ultra doesn't even have developer options enabled and literally has never been connected to ADB, ever.\nSamsung couldn't care less so I'm also making it known on Google's forum. \n*Forgot to add, Knox is perfectly happy and fuse is not tripped, just again proving I play no part in why my incredibly expensive paperweight can't have access to Google's services.",

Very annoying bug.\n\nI'm not logged in Google Pass Manager, the passes are stored on local device.\nThe passwords pop up when need be so they're still stored, and they're working ok in Chrome. I can see the full list of my pass in the Password Manager.\n\nBUT when I try to access a password to edit/delete it, or try to export list of passwords (see video), or any operation that requires authentication, I get a verify identity prompt via fingerprint / pattern that appears to be broken !\n\nAlthough the print/pattern I input is OK, the program doesn't go further ! Nothing happens, I'm at the same place before the identify prompt showed up and I can do this all day, it never goes further.\n\nThere are no errors as my fingerprint and pattern are correct but it just doesn't proceed to the next screen/command !!\n\n\nA video here:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/dCdeNUh\n\nAnd no I do NOT wish to clear Play Services data and lose all my passwords! (clear cache didn't help).\n\nMy biometric fingerprint / pattern still work perfect on all my other apps that require them on the same device, no problem, they're ONLY broken (do nothing) in Google Password Manager.\n\nPlease help or fix ASAP.",

In the example I gave there's Tarot but I had wallpaper, chom.vehu and others) but they always return a few hours later. ALWAYS.\n\nAFTER doing a factory reset it seems things go back to normal but then after a few days it all starts coming up again: sysclimb > falcon > (any other adware garbage) over and over again.\n\nI just had Whatsapp installed all this time, nothing else and by now I have a somewhat better understanding on cybersecurity so I know NOT to click on something, install anything etc all the usual advice.\n\nWhat's really happening on here?

If I'm holding the phone in my left hand, say I'm on the treadmill, I used to be able to turn it on/off with a flick of my thumb. Now, I need to either bend my hand into a claw or use both hands. This removes the \"quick\" part of the \"quick bar\".\n\nWas this a recent update? If so, can I turn the new process off? I'll happily use multiple taps and multiple menus to make the Bluetooth button a single tap again.",

    "user_question": "I have a weird problem. An important Android 11 phone's WiFi is no longer working. I'm told that it's an unfixable hardware problem. I want to tether it to the WiFi connection of another working Android 12 phone using Bluetooth. That working phone is accessing the Internet through WiFi. When I try tethering through Bluetooth, the working phone says \"Your plan doesn't support mobile tethering.\" I am not trying to tether the mobile connection (in fact, the mobile connection is off). What I'm trying to tether is the WiFi connection. \n\nHow can I tether onto the WiFi connection of another device? I think I've seen someone tether off a tablet that was WiFi only.\n\nIf this isn't impossible, what are my options? Is USB tethering possible between the two phones? Even if a USB connection is possible, will the working phone give me the same error? I don't want to throw away the broken phone.\n\nThis is for my homebound grandparents who don't want to spend money on another mobile plan for the broken phone. And they don't want to throw away the expensive broken phone which is otherwise functional. Thanks for any help.",

    "issue_type": "Wi-Fi Connectivity / Bluetooth",
    "user_question": "Situation 1: When the PC and the smartphone are both connected to the same WiFi network from home broadband, nearby sharing uses WiFi bandwidth that is constrained, keeping the speed below 10 MBps or 80 mbps. Both directions, from Windows to Android and vice versa, experience the same transfer speed, that's the maximum speed of the broadband.\n\nSituation 2: When none of the devices are connected to the home Broadband or the router is purposefully turned off, sharing files from a smartphone running Android 13 to a PC running Windows 11, the speed is just pitiful, as slow as it is on Bluetooth, measured in KBps. Once investigating the problem, it uncovered that the WiFi direct connection only operates at 2.4 GHz. I reckon, the transfer speed would have been higher only if the devices were connected at the 5 GHz frequency WiFi-Direct. When transferring files or a folder from Windows PC to Android smartphone, the situation is reversed for goodness sake, and the standard 40 MBps transfer speed is reinstated.\n\nN.B. It should be noted that the testing and replication were carried out using a Pixel 7a, OnePlus, Motorola and Xiaomi phone, and a Windows 10 and 11 PCs. Restarting the devices, installing the Google Play and Nearby Share services again, and changing the data transfer mode to 'wifi only' or 'without internet' - didn't resolve the problems.",

I don't have unlimited data and frequently work out in the boonies with little to no cell reception anyway. I typically rely on offline downloads for most of my consumed content. My home WiFi network is very strong, and I took both screenshots while sat near my router. YouTube and the Google Play store both refuse to download claiming that they're waiting for WiFi, when the WiFi is clearly connected. While getting screenshots for this post, I did find that I could override the Play Store issue by manually telling it to update my apps, but there is no manual button for the YouTube app to force it to download my offline videos. I'd like to also note that this does not happen on other WiFi networks away from my home. I typically get all my Google App related downloads done on work WiFi instead. Again, I only have this issue with Google apps. I have no issues downloading offline content on Spotify, Paramount+, Netflix, etc. Thanks for reading pls help",

This is not how your flagship Pixels should perform, especially when they didn't when they were first released.\n\nUpdate: My phone doesn't seem to be getting hot anymore. My battery life might not be as bad as it was, but I've turned a few other things off so I'm not sure if it's just those being the reason. The drain is still much more than it should be. An update in the play store for the Carrier Services app seems it could have made the slight improvement I've noticed.",

And the mobile network is responsible for 60% of battery consumption.\n\n Expected behavior:\n When the user turns on the flight mode, the radio module turns off completely and does not consume battery power.\n When the esim or physical sim card is turned off, it does not consume battery power.",

I have to manualy close the screen every time. \nIn the \"Custom restrictions\" menu \"Don't turn on screen\" is checked and \"Don't wake for notifications\" is checked. \nIn \"Developer options\" \"Stay awake\" is unchecked. \nI tired a factory reset no help there.\nI tried multiple chargers and cables, even charging from a PC does the same thing.\nIt's not a big deal for me i'm just afraid of screen burn in the long term so i tried activating a screensaver while charging, i chose the clock as a screensaver but nothing happens when i plug the charger it just stays on at the last page i was in when i put the phone down witch was again very odd. I'm kind of desperate so any help would be appreciated.\nThank you in advance and i hope you all have a nice day.",

I lose so much battery by just having my phone on and looking at the stats it's mobile network that uses 82% (!!) of my battery. Having the phone in flight mode helps but it kind of defeats the purpose of a phone and is certainly not a long term solution.\n\nI frequently visit Finland and I noticed something strange - here, my phone works just like it did before. Great battery life, I can go throughout the day without charging my phone (I have to charge it several times in Germany...), no overheating issues. Whenever I come back to Germany it becomes unbearable again. Mobile network uses a lot of battery, I lose 10-20% in an hour without even picking up the phone, it becomes super hot etc... \n\nIt can't be my mobile network provider since it worked well for so many months but it stopped working properly after the June/July update. I don't really know what to do anymore. \n\nI'm attaching a screenshot of my battery usage in Finland and one in Germany. The difference is just huge.

The screen has come fully off after it slowly started expanding beginning in September. I did not know it was a serious problem until last month when there was actually space beginning to show between the case and the screen. A local shop has told me that my battery has swollen and even without charging the device it could explode or catch fire without warning. I am travelling and unable to get a certified repair on the device and I am worried about the safety and legality of taking this machine on a plane home. What can I do? Some reading has shown that this is a known issue with Google Pixel 5s and I really feel like this is a significant safety concern for the manufacturer, but right now I am more worried about my safety having this unusable and unstable machine in my bag.  @MadeByGoogle",

    "user_question": "It gets really hard to trust Google as a phone brand when they seem not to care at all for the customers or product quality. This is my third Pixel phone and the second that has hardware issues. I had a Pixel 5a 5G that suddenly had a screen problem (many other people complaining about the same thing here on Reddit). Contacted support and they said there was nothing they could do since the phone was out of warranty and I live in a non-supported country.\n\nNow, my Pixel 7a with just a few months out of warranty has presented a different hardware issue: the battery is swollen and the phone is overheating. The back of the phone is detaching itself (even the camera bump). The phone just works if it's plugged in and it heats like crazy. Even when it's plugged in, it suddenly turns off. Today, after contacting Google via chat and being told to wait for an email, the phone just stopped turning on (it does not pass the Google logo when booting). I have performed a factory reset using the Google Pixel Update and Software Repair website and I could manage to make it work again. A few minutes into setting up the apps, the phone overheats one more time, and the same issue with the Google logo when booting shows up.\n\nThe pure Android experience is great, but Google cannot hold a reputation as a phone brand when it seems most Pixel phones present some sort of weird (and in this case, quite DANGEROUS) hardware issues. I am aware, as a buyer and user, that I live in a country (Brazil) where these phones are not sold, but this is a dangerous issue that should not happen in the first place. I had Samsung phones, Motorola phones, even a Nokia phone and none of them were as problematic as Google ones!",

    "user_question": "I've got a pixel 6 I bought in May 2022, so the phone is not even two years old. Starting this week, once the phone gets around 80-78% battery, it will drain completely to zero in SECONDS. \n\nFirst time it happened I thought I had been scrolling tiktok for too long and not paying attention to the battery. Then it happened a few more times when I realized my phone had like 75% battery remaining only a few minutes ago and suddenly it was asking me if I wanted to turn on battery saver because it was at 20%, and the percentage was draining down to zero before my eyes seconds after the message popped up. It's happened multiple times since then and I've tried to look out for the battery percentage range where it will suddenly drop off to zero. \n\nYesterday I was leaving work, had been using the phone my regular amount. I had upgraded to Android 14 the day before thinking it might fix it. Charge was just under 80% when leaving, and by the time I drove home (approximately 10 minutes) I checked my phone and it had DIED with the battery completely drained.\n\nI'm beyond frustrated. After poking around online it seems like this is some kind of battery failure. Yesterday it took leaving it on the charger from 2pm until 7am this morning for the battery to charge back to 100! I've never factory reset my phone but I guess this is the next troubleshooting step before I have to find a repair shop to replace the battery? \n\nMy previous phone was a Pixel 3 and I used it until the battery was so worn out it needed to be on a charger for life support. I have been very careful with this phone to extend the life of the battery so I don't go through the same thing with it in a couple years. But now the battery is fried somehow after 1.5 years of normal use. What the hell do I do to fix this?",

    "user_question": "This morning, I noticed that my Pixel 2 XL was charging much slower than usual. My deduction was right, when I locked the phone, on the bottom of the screen it says \"charging rapidly, 4 hours remaining\". 4 hours, that ain't right.\n\nThat's when I unplug my charger from the electric socket. \nNote: this is a new (used) charger I bought roughly a good few weeks ago, and they were in mint condition when they came in.\n\nI currently live in Indonesia so I have to use an adapter to use this charger (first picture).\nI noticed this rather apparent burnt marks on the tip of my charger's electrode (second picture). My guess it's the adapter not properly transmitting the current to my charger and onto my phone, thus the burnt electrodes.\n\nThey worked perfectly fine the first few days of having it, and I believe, continued to do so until this very morning. It's either the charger or the adapter, my guess is the latter. Although that is also rather baffling because this adapter came from a notable manufacturer company, Krisbow. \n\nI'm not looking forward to replacing my charger as it is still very new and costs a premium. \nAny suggestions on what I should do? Thank you.",

They already received the money in their Payoneer accounts within three to four days.But because my process came in a different way, I didn't get a chance to apply for a Pioneer account. That's why I don't understand how I can resolve my issue or even after five days of my application. But still no solution is coming from Google 😓So I want you to contact me as soon as possible, if necessary, today or tomorrow. I already have a Payoneer account, but they are not asking me for it yet.  But currently, the battery is in such bad condition that it doesn't even last two to two and a half hours. I have to charge it 5-7 times a day. After the July update, the mobile is no longer in a good condition to run it due to the battery.",

It seems like keeping \"Adaptive Connectivity\" -> Turned Off is better. Had to disable \"Adaptive Charging\" as well for faster charges.\n\n\nAlso, Regardless of the settings above, their are some episodes were the Phone gets warmer/hotter to touch just with basic usages. I mean like no camera or gaming or such.. Just Instagram or Youtube and battery drains like crazy during these times.

    "user_question": "I only noticed my problem after purchasing a USB-C power meter. To test how fast my phone charges, I connected it to my 100W Baseus charger using the original cable that came with the phone. The meter showed a voltage of 9V and a current that rose above 2A and dropped to 0A after a second, then rose again to 2A and dropped again the video. I thought the charger or meter might be to blame. When testing with other chargers (e.g. Samsung 25W), the meter showed the same thing. I did a similar test with 3 different car chargers and the situation was identical. To rule out the meter's fault, I connected the phone directly to the car charger that supports PD 3.0, and the charger to the laboratory power supply to check the current consumption of the charger itself. The laboratory power supply showed similar behavior to the meter's for USB-C. The charger's power consumption increased to 20W, only to drop below 1W after a while, and so on and so forth the video. I tested on 3 different car chargers and different cables, and nothing changed. I did a similar test with a mains charger, i.e. I connected the phone directly to it (without a meter), while I connected the charger itself to the meter and to a 230V socket. And here the behavior is similar to that of a car charger connected to a laboratory power supply. Another thing that indicates that something is wrong with the phone switching from slower to faster charging is how the phone behaves during charging when the screen is locked. Information about fast charging appears and disappears, and the clock font also changes as in a situation when the phone switches to a different charging mode the video\nWatching a random Pixel 8 charging test on YouTube, something like this does not occur, and the charging parameters displayed on the meter screen are constant and the current slowly drops with the increase in the phone's charge and does not jump as in my case.

When I plugged it in, it took a long time to show 0%, and shortly after, I noticed the back cover starting to lift.\nAs time passed, the separation increased, and it seems like something inside the phone is swelling more and more. For safety reasons, I turned it off, but the back cover keeps detaching further. I'm concerned that the battery is defective and could pose a safety risk.\nI need urgent assistance on how to proceed. I would appreciate a quick response, as a swollen battery can be dangerous.\nDevice details:\nModelo: Google Pixel 7A\nNúmero de serie EID: 89033023427100000000027260888877\n\nVanessa Youhannai Crespo\n\n\nHola, equipo de soporte de Google.\nHoy noté un problema grave con mi Google Pixel. Al despertar, mi celular estaba apagado con la batería en 0%, lo cual me pareció extraño porque recordaba que aún tenía carga. Al conectarlo, tardó en mostrar el 0% y, poco después, noté que la tapa trasera comenzaba a despegarse.\nCon el paso del tiempo, la separación ha ido aumentando y parece que algo dentro del teléfono se está inflando más y más. Por precaución, lo apagué, pero la carcasa sigue separándose. Me preocupa que la batería esté defectuosa y represente un riesgo de seguridad.\nNecesito asistencia urgente sobre cómo proceder. Agradecería una respuesta rápida, ya que la batería inflada puede ser peligrosa.\nDatos del dispositivo:\nModelo: Google Pixel 7A\nNúmero de serie EID: 89033023427100000000027260888877\n\nVanessa Youhannai Crespo",

Recently, the battery started draining at an alarming rate — dropping from 60% to 2% in just a few minutes before shutting down completely.\n\nMore disturbingly, the battery has swollen, causing the back panel of the phone to bulge visibly. This is not just a defect — it's a serious safety hazard. A swollen battery can lead to overheating, leakage, or even fire, and it’s unacceptable in a modern smartphone.\n\nI have relied on this device for daily use, but it is now completely unusable and unsafe. It’s shocking that such a critical issue could arise in a relatively new phone.\n\nThis is probably my last Pixel phone, and I will strongly recommend my family and friends never purchase a Google phone again.

I suspect that maybe the battery has swollen but I am not sure as this appears to be on the right edge corner and I haven't noticed any other battery related issues such as very fast drainage or high temperatures. \n\nI want to assess whether there's a need for immediate battery or device replacement please advise.",

    "user_question": "Significant battery drain\n\nI'm looking to see if anyone's been experiencing a lot of battery drain issues. So just to start off I have a pixel 8 pro. I've only had it since last October. And of course the battery life has been really good. Usually it will last me into the next morning. Now I have been using the phone for YouTube, Android auto and Spotify. I played at the settings so background data won't be draining the battery and of course change the screen brightness. For instance, I charge my phone last night into this morning. I pulled off the charger around 8:16 a.m. It's now 9:20 and while I've only dropped 4% my estimated time till full depletion is only 9:15 p.m. I've had heavy usage on the phone before and I've still managed to make it last pretty much either till next morning or very late at night. Maybe my usage is a lot heavier than it's been, but I'm not entirely sure. I know as phones get older. The battery start to have shorter cycles but the phone's not that old and neither is the battery. I'm charging using the phone the way I've used other phones especially on my pixel 7 pro before the screen went. The only thing it's changed is of course the software updates right now I'm on 15 (BP1A.250505.005.B1). I know version 16 is on the horizon and I don't know if it's going to fix this problem. Maybe it's a hardware issue. Maybe it's a defective battery? I really don't know and of course the diagnostics that I'm running aren't really giving me anything conclusive. So if anyone's having this experience with this particular phone or even a generation newer let me know. I would like to resolve this issue.",

    "user_question": "My Google Pixel 5 battery percentage sometimes drops suddenly from wherever it is at to a much lower value after reboot, or earlier today, even while using the phone. I have already tried things like turning off the \"mobile data always active,\" and have tried changing the settings for items like \"adaptive battery\" and \"adaptive charging\" to on and off but it appears to make no difference. Some of the threads seem to suggest that turning off 5G makes it better, but my phone is usually on Wifi at home, and yet it still happens.\n\nThis is totally ridiculous because I have had this phone for only a couple of months now, and cannot trust this device to last: the only reason I bought it was that Google wouldn't provide any more security updates on my Pixel 2XL, which still performs like a champ, otherwise.\n\nGoogle engineers: some of the responses in related threads seem to suggest that a fix was out in December/January, but I am on the latest, May 5, 2021 patch and am still seeing this. Any suggestions would be helpful but an actual fix that addresses the issue would be ideal!",

    "user_question": "Hi. \nI've bought my pixel 6a in late December. I love my phone but I have been experiencing phone idle battery drain issues since the start. \nI've restricted background access for most of the applications installed, it hasn't helped. Even received the January update but it didn't help. I have the habit of switching off all internet options (wifi and cellular) but severe battery drain happens overnight nevertheless. \nFor instance, the day before yesterday, battery was at 29% when I was about to sleep (12:30AM) and then when I woke up yesterday (9AM), it was down to 7%. So yesterday, thought of using battery saver mode overnight. The battery was at 40% when I went to bed (11PM) but when I woke up today (7AM), it was down to 9%, now I wonder what battery saver is for. \nThis is extremely bad considering that I was using budget smartphones earlier (Motorola one) and I used to get almost 2-2.5 days of battery on a similar level of usage (I don't game, all I do is watch YouTube or use Instagram). \nI've attached the battery usage screenshots for yesterday as reference. Any kind of assistance is welcome. Thanks.",

No particular apps are draining the battery, phone idle alone does it. \n\nI thought after the June update, it will make the battery backup better but I think it made it even worse. Last night I charged my phone to 100% and slept by turning off WiFi and mobile data. I even kept my network type to 3G to avoid background activities from 4G. And waking up after 5-6 hrs of sleep, I found my battery to be 89%. Details attached below. This is very disappointing. I bought this phone on February. It has not been a year and this is the performance I get from a flagship?\n\nClearly this is not normal. Phone Idle draining 78% of my phone's battery is crazy. I used to get 2 days of battery backup before that March update. And now I can hardly survive 16hrs.

    "category": "Battery",
    "issue_type": "Battery / Performance / Stability",
    "user_question": "Sometime in the late summer or early fall of 2020, right around when Android 11 dropped (although I'm not sure if it perfectly coincided with upgrading to Android 11), I started to notice a pretty heavy standby battery drain on my Pixel 3a (2-3% per hour). Instead of lasting two days with 6-8 hours SOT, as it had for the first year I owned it, my battery was discharging so quickly on standby that it would die in about two days with the screen off.\n\nI dealt with the battery drain for few months on stock Android 11. Eventually I was at my wits end trying and failing to find solutions, so I decided to downgrade to Android 10 and switch to CalyxOS (a private near-stock Android ROM) with the thought that removing Google's spyware might help. Unfortunately, the drain persisted. I have since upgraded to Android 11 on CalyxOS and the drain is still here. My battery stats constantly show high usage from Android System (usually more than the screen), Wi-Fi, Standby, and sometimes Android OS.\n\nLet me give you a rundown of some of my settings to make it clear how ridiculous this battery drain is:\nBluetooth and Wi-Fi scanning off.\nWi-Fi on, but with Mobile Data Always Active off.\nBluetooth off.\nNFC off.\nLocation services off.\nAmbient display off.\nHotspot/tethering off.\nVPN off.\n\"Ok Google\" off (the Google app is actually uninstalled).\nAll gestures off (e.g. Lift to check phone).\nCell signal is great. It's consistently three or four bars in my apartment.\nOnly 9 apps registered for push notifications (turning off push notifications doesn't solve the drain): Bitwarden, Duolingo, GroupMe, Nanoleaf, Photos, ProtonMail, Signal, YouTube, YouTube Music\nOnly 7 accounts syncing (turning off auto-sync doesn't solve the drain): Two DAVx5 accounts (for contact/calendar sync), Duolingo, Google, GroupMe, NextCloud, and Signal\n\nHere are some of the things I've tried that haven't stopped the drain:\nBattery saver mode\nSafe mode\nFactory reset\nReverting to Android 10 (I did this before moving to Calyx OS and then ran Calyx OS on Android 10 for a month or two before upgrading to Android 11 again)\nSwitching to microG for Google Play Services (bundled with Calyx OS)\nSwitching to 5GHz Wi-Fi (I usually connect to 2.4GHz)\n\nThe one thing I've done to successfully stop the drain has been the following:\nTurn off Wi-Fi.\nRestart the phone.\nLeave Wi-Fi off.\n\nHowever, I only have a 4GB data plan and I use probably 20-30GB of Wi-Fi data per month. This is at best an extremely short term workaround. I also don't think this has worked every time, but I know it's at least worked a couple of times for me.\n\n----\n\nThe following screenshots are battery stats from two days ago. To get these, I turned on safe mode, charged my phone to full, and then just sat it on my desk with the screen off all afternoon (aside from turning on the screen once in the middle to check the battery). I had 1 minute of SOT over the entire charge and I lost 17% battery. There are an insane amount of wakelocks going on, leading to almost two hours of screen-off uptime of the ~6.5 hours it was sitting on my table. Almost all of these seem to be coming from the Wi-Fi radio.\n\n\n\n---\n\nAny suggestions of things to try or solutions would be very welcome. I'd also be happy to share more stats from this charge (or a non-safe-mode charge) if that would be helpful.\n\nI'm just so tired and frustrated at this point. The longer this goes on, the more charge cycles get added to my battery, and the worse my battery life is going to be over time. This same exact thing massacred my old Nexus 5's battery and I really don't want to have that happen again :(",

    "user_question": "Hello!\n\nI've been experiencing a noticeable battery drain over night for a couple of month already (maybe since the Android 13 update sometime in August, but also maybe even before that). The default battery usage menu just shows 30% Android OS or more. I finally took some time and dug a little deeper. Using BetterBatteryStats I could rule out background apps and I can cleary see that the device never goes into Deep Sleep due to wakelocks from system processes. In the screenshot from below you can see that 4 processes (usbpb0, epoll_heath*, a600000.ssusb, usb) keep spamming wakelocks (recorded since a reboot this afternoon), every refresh the count of the usb* processes increases by about 20. \n\nMy Phone is a Pixel 4a (Hardware MP1.0) and on the latest update of Android 13: \nSystem Update: 1 Oct 2022\nSecurity Update: 5 Oct 2022\n\nI did not find any information with this specific issue and the Pixel 4a elsewhere, maybe someone from here can help.

    "user_question": "So my brand new Pixel 4a seems to have developed a serious problem with its battery.\n\nThis is a new device purchased for Christmas about 4 weeks ago.\n\nA few days ago I noticed that with 40-50% charge, I would wake up to a dead phone after 8 hours of sleep.\n\nLast night I tested this problem by doing the following:\n\nUninstalled Facebook and about 10 other unnecessary apps which might be draining battery.\nEnabled extreme battery saver, adaptive charging, checked battery optimization is on for all possible apps, and enabled all possible adaptive battery settings.\nCharged to 100% before bed then unplugged it.\nClosed all open apps, activated do not disturb and airplane mode, turned off location services and WiFi and Bluetooth.\nThe battery then drained, on phone idle, from 100 down to 34 percent in less than 9 hours. That's a loss of nearly SEVENTY percent battery overnight on idle.\n\nWhat the heck is going on? Is this just a faulty battery?\n\nEvidence from my Battery Usage statistics - the phone detects zero apps used overnight other than Idle, and claims that Idle only used 1% battery while it was draining the entire time:\n\n\n\nA couple of potential causes I can think of:\nI have been playing a mobile game Legends of Runeterra for several hours per day, maybe this is too demanding for a Pixel 4a and has messed something up internally?\nI bought the phone in the UK but am now living in New Zealand. The charger is being used through a cheap plug adapter (and obviously different voltage etc) which has fried the internal battery components?\n\n\nAny advice would be massively appreciated...\n\nCould this be a software/hardware problem?\n\nI will try the 'Safe Mode' troubleshooting approach when I go to sleep tonight, and then consider a Factory Reset tomorrow.",

    "user_question": "I purchased the Pixel 6a just 2 days back. While the Android experience is amazing, I'm really getting concerned for the battery. I fully charged the phone 6 hours back and just after some casual usage I'm down to 45% battery. \n\nApp usage is only 33%, but the system usage is enormous. 30% battery was just used up by mobile network, phone idle and wifi. And it's not like I'm traveling, I've been sitting in my office since I fully charged the device. My wifi router is at an arms length. And my 24 hours screen time is merely 3 hours 45 mins. 1 hour is the one I used it the previous night. So basically just after 2½ hours of casual usage I'm down 50%.\n\nComing from my OnePlus Nord of 3 years this is a huge concern for me. That device used to last me easily 2 days on casual usage. Also I've updated to the lastest software version so it's probably not that issue. My Bluetooth and autorotate are also turned off. \n\nNot to forget, the left side of the device randomly heats up in an AC room after 15 minutes of scrolling through Instagram \n\nLet me know what I should do?",

I was very happy with it with no major complaints, only being the fact that the battery is worse than the competition but it's acceptable and i don't mind it. It was fair enough but for the last 2-3 days it has been disgustingly worse. Like I understand, machines are not perfect and they will have issues and the battery performs worse usually after a software/security update but again, the problem wouldn't persist for more than 3 days.\n\nNow it hasn't been 3 whole days and i understand that, but I've been light using my phone and checked everything that takes most of my battery, I tried everything from restarting my phone to archiving apps I don't use. The problem still persists and infact it's actually worse than the occasional drainage after a software/security update.\n\nSince Pixels dont have a fully detailed way to check battery health, I use AccuBattery since I got my Pixel and my phone's almost 70 cycles and it's reading recently says that my phone's capacity is 99% though i know this reading does keep changing when my battery performs better but it has been saying 99% for almost a whole week with nothing to show. I've put screenshots attached with this post to compare the performance with the performance a few days ago (note the screen time reading is not accurate)\n\n\nI would like to know what can I further do to deal with this drainage as it's causing me inconvenience.",

    "user_question": "Update: Pixel 7a Battery Swelling – Still Waiting for a Safe Resolution\n\nHi everyone,\nI wanted to provide an update on the Pixel 7a battery swelling issue I posted about earlier.\nThe situation has worsened: the battery has swollen to the point where the back panel is now detached at two corners and visibly warped. I’ve reached out to Google support, and while they’ve suggested a repair process through their service partner, I’m extremely concerned about the safety of shipping the device in its current condition. It feels unsafe to handle due to the risk of further damage or even a fire hazard.\nI’ve attached updated photos showing the extent of the swelling for reference. I’m still waiting for specific guidance from Google on how to safely proceed with a repair, but I haven’t received any clear instructions yet.\nHas anyone else faced this level of battery swelling, and how did you resolve it? I’m particularly looking for advice on how to deal with a device that seems unsafe to touch or ship.\nAny feedback or suggestions from the community or from someone who has dealt with a similar issue would be really helpful. Thanks again for your support, and I hope this post helps others who might be dealing with the same issue.\nBest regards,\nHelpless pixel phone buyer",

I would go a full day and a half with heavy usage (emails, calendar, pictures and video, live chat, etc) without having to charge the phone. Now I can see the battery dropping without doing anything.\n\nI've done all the usual troubleshooting (factory reset, safe mode, setting all apps to auto update, etc.) but nothing has worked.  And what's pissing me off even more is Google refuses to acknowledge the problem! Instead they rather put blame on the user saying \"Everyone uses their device differently and results may vary blah blah blah.....\" The typical corporate hogwash that big companies say when doing damage control. \n\nThis is unacceptable, I've been a long time Android fan since day one but I think it's time to switch to the other side!",

Set it up and was prompted upon opening the camera that the new motion features were available. However, there is no Motion option to scroll to. I do have a long exposure option but no way to toggle to Action Pan. Spent way too long with support who first blamed it on the need for a security update (didn't help). Have uninstalled and reinstalled the camera app. After another hour on with support they suggested replacing the phone, as if this one was missing a part that was causing only this one feature to be unavailable. I haven't been able to find anyone else encountering this issue through a search.",

I had to install version 9.2 and I discovered that this issue didn't exist. This made it easier to adjust the brightness or shadow from the adjustment panel whenever I want without having to press the settings button frequently. I think this is a bug that Google needs to fix. \n\nA workaround for the versions 9.4 and 9.5 is this; using night mode to shoot. This way, the adjustment sliders panel will remain on the screen allowing you to make adjustments whenever you please. Unfortunately I'm unable to attach a screen record of what I'm describing. I think screenshots will suffice. \n\nUnfortunately, I wouldn't want to shoot with night mode in the day when I can use the default photo mode. Please Google, fix this.",

    "user_question": "(Translated using Google Translate)\nGood day. I recently became the proud owner of a Pixel 7. I won't hide the fact that I bought it with an eye on good photo capabilities in its price segment.\nThe device takes great photos (sometimes there are problems with post-processing, but overall I'm happy with everything), but something strange is happening with the video. When recording video during the day and early evening (especially when there are a lot of trees in the frame), the standard camera app starts to wildly oversaturate the picture and overestimate the contrast, which is why the picture starts to crumble and noticeably lose quality. At first I thought that the problem was in the HDR 10-bit mode, but I always have it turned off. Playing with manual settings was also unsuccessful. I tried deleting updates, resetting the cache, but the result is the same. And the problem is not in the hardware, in the third-party Open Camera application everything is fine with color correction. Below is a comparison.\n\n(The left photo may look like the street is lit by sunset light, but it is not, and the right photo has a more natural lighting)\n\nSometimes the viewfinder image looks natural, but after stopping the recording, when viewing the resulting fragment, oversaturation and strong contrast appear. As far as I know, Google Camera has recently been forcibly using HDR processing algorithms, without the ability to turn it off. If this mode is used by default in videos, can HDR algorithms produce such artifacts and is there a chance that in the future the camera app will not process the image so aggressively? Has anyone else encountered the same problem and how did you solve it (if you could)? Of course, you can use Open Camera, but it does not support video stabilization.",

I've seen many people flagging the same issue in Camera app reviews on Google Play regarding Pixel (mostly pixel 2). Is there any fix planned?",

    "user_question": "I recently moved to Zimbabwe and before leaving Canada, I bought a new cell phone, the Google Pixel 8 Pro.  I bought this phone specifically for the camera and for the most part I've been very happy with it.  However there is one major fly in the ointment.  When I go on safari, I'm in a truck with animals in the background.  Whenever I ask someone to take pictures of me with the animals in the background, the rear facing camera automatically focuses on me and the animals are a blurry mess.  The camera isn't in portrait mode, it just blurs the background on its own.  My previous cell phone (Samsung A50) doesn't do this.  Both I and the animals are in focus.  When I take a selfie using the front facing camera on my Pixel the issue also resolves itself.   I don't want to have to carry two cell phones with me when I go on safari, because I like the Pixel better for pictures of the animals without me in them. And I don't want to have to always take selfies with the animals either, because it can be hard to line up selfies.  I've tried using the unblur feature on the phone to fix the blurry pictures after they've already been taken, and it definitely is an improvement over the original pictures, but it looks somewhat fake and harsh and I'm not totally happy with the result.  Surely there must be someway that I can fix the settings in my phone so that I can just take the picture well in the first place and not have to try to use AI to fix it on the back end.   I've attached pictures of the problem.  They are as follows:\n1) A picture taken on my old cell phone, which is exactly what I want the pictures on my Pixel to look like.\n2) The same picture taken on my Pixel (this is the problem.)\n3) Picture two unblurred after the fact, but it looks quite fake.",

In one instance a street lamp and in another a full moon. I've noticed a blue spot/flare/reflection that seems to move as I move the camera to focus. It seems to be a light being emitted from the camera itself. I'm guessing some sort of focus function. When I zoom in user pinch to zoom via the camera the spot becomes larger. I'm green when it comes to photography matters, so maybe someone can explain the effect as well why the camera is doing that. Is this a bug? I've read reports about the halo effect and the circumstances under which that effect was reproduced seems similar to my issue.",

    "user_question": "I've seen quite a few people mentioning the Google pixel 7/ 8 rear camera glass braking randomly. Happened to me about 3 days after buying the phone. Google pixel 8 pro just sitting in my jacket pocket took it out and had the circular smash over the lens / microphone bit. Glass shattered out the way. No damage to the lens. Google are trying to charge £150 to pix it. Which is mental for a piece of glass and also crazy as it's a know issue and a design flaw by the looks of it. Every time we try to speak to a Google agent they just say it's cracked so no warranty. One guy even just ended the chat session while I was typing. \n\nAnyone have any luck getting this problem resolved. I even tried to put in a complaint but don't think the guy even put it through. Customer service is so bad. Partner was just away to get a pixel 9 but going to look for something else now.",

I purchased two Pixel 5 devices and so far the camera quality is horrible. In both the front and rear facing camera I am experiencing the same quality issues. Blurred photos, noise, no clarity or details, etc. It's comparable to the very first digital camera I ever owned in early 2000. I contacted support a few times, they suggested a few soft items and factory reset. This did nothing to resolve the issues. They then suggested to take it to be \"fixed\" at an authorized store (Ubreakifix). The store did not have parts or believed it would be a hardware issue they could fix. Finally, they offered to replace ONE of the phones? Ok. We will see if the replacement device is better, but I feel it's a fundamental flaw in the current hardware / design. I will come back with an update once the replacement comes, but I am not hopeful. At this point I would not recommend buying a pixel 5 - especially if you use it for your main camera like most people. Worst. Camera. Ever.",

The attached two pictures show the difference when you look at the top of the settee, the one with the flash below the lens shows a shadow along the full length of it, this same shadow effect is found around the heads of individuals in any pictures you take this way.",

Everything seems to be fine and I am also tried in a daylight picture but the colour still remain the same. I can physically see a greenish green. I have a pen in green colour but the phone doesn't display it as a green. I've also searched for some reviews and I found out it's not just me who's got this problem. There are also other users with pixel 9 Pro XL with the same issue. Do you know if there is a solution for this? Happy to try any troubleshooting. Thank you.\n\nAs you can see the colour of the pen and the dress is not that colour. I've attached the photos taken in the night, day and inside home with light.",

    "user_question": "I took a photo and the preview on some apps is different to the photo when I select it. It appears as though the magic eraser has been applied to the photo but is only being applied once the photo is opened. I would like to access the photo as I see it in the previews. Attached is an example of what the photo looks like in preview vs what it looks like when opened/selected. I have pixelated the face of the person in the preview photo for privacy reasons but it is just a normal photo. I have done nothing to the 2nd. Additionally in some apps when I select the photo to view in full size it starts off very briefly as the actual photo only to quickly fade into the 2nd photo attached. This makes me think there is some kind of strange processing happening when the photo is opened or uploaded. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",

Normally, it works fine, but when the resolution is 16:9 and 1280x720 or below the result is very, very poor, basically unusable - all detail is gone creating a very smeared image. Even when there is no, or very little noise. I've attached screenshots of the different resolutions (I thought I could attach more, but apparently only two are allowed), with noise filtering being set to high quality (hq) and disabled (none). I'm using the Camera2Video sample from the android/camera-samples GitHub repository. Is this normal? It happens when using both the front and the back camera, though the attached images are of the primary back camera. I've also compared the exact same set up on my Asus zenfone 9, and there it looks fine.",

Everything I read online touted the superiority of the 3 camera and that they were the same ones being used in the 3a, but I was never disappointed in my 2's camera and love using it. These pics on the 3a are consistently slightly blurry and lacking in detail... I've tried all the troubleshooting options for fixing camera focus but it's not as if *where* the camera focuses is the issue--it's that the spot it is focused on is never as sharp as it was on the 2. Cleared cache, tried safe mode, etc. Quality still sucks.\n\nUnfortunately I was 2 days too late to just return it otherwise I would've had the crack in my 2's screen repaired and kept using that. Now I'm not sure if this is something I should send the phone in to have fixed under the warranty, or if I failed to understand some aspect of the 3a's camera that would explain the poor quality and I've just wasted several hundred bucks?\n\nI've taken several dozen side-by-side comparison shots and attached one to explain what I'm talking about. Obviously the 3a's is an 'acceptable' photograph and would've been great a decade ago, but it clearly looks like a downgrade in quality to me.\n\nInfo says both were taken at ƒ/1.8 and the 2 was 1/120 while the 3a was 1/125",

    "user_question": "I am writing to express my extreme disappointment with the camera performance of my new Pixel 9, specifically regarding excessive light flare in night photography.  I recently took several night-time photos, including a comparison shot with a friend's iPhone. While their iPhone image captured the scene with clarity and minimal flare, my Pixel 9's image was significantly degraded by substantial light flare from the background building lights. The resulting image lacked clarity and was far below the standard I expect from a premium device, especially one marketed for its photographic capabilities.\nI want to emphasize that my phone is brand new, and the camera lens is clean and undamaged.  Therefore, this issue cannot be attributed to user error or neglect.  Given the significant investment I made in the Pixel 9, I find this level of performance unacceptable.  The reputation of the Pixel line, and a key factor in my purchasing decision, was its supposed superior camera quality.  This experience has fallen far short of those expectations and frankly, leaves me regretting my purchase.  I am seriously considering whether I should have chosen a competitor's device, such as the Samsung S25, as their camera performance now appears to be superior in these conditions.\nI am deeply dissatisfied with the current performance and expect a response outlining the steps you will take to rectify this problem.  I am open to suggestions on how to correct this.",

Happens in Snapchat when camera is opened. \n\nI have ensured all apps are up to date, I have cleared storage and cache of camera app every time after it happens, I have confirmed all software updates are up to date. \n\nThis is extremely frustrating for a brand new phone. I just need transparency if this is a known software issue that will be fixed or if I need to return and get an S25 ultra. \n\nI've seen other locked posts about this with no solution, and no real response from Google team.",

My phone is almost a year old and subjected to knocks and bumps from everyday life but I don't remember it ever having a really bad fall, especially in the past week - which, on review, is when the images started being affected.

Any papers, any documents look the same. It's like a permanent motion blur, like you're rushing into the object you're taking photo of, like you zooming into it even if you're keeping the phone perfectly still.\nIt is tolerable when you make landscape photos, but any objects, any text is just bad. I was taking photos today and at some point I gave up and used 5 years old iPhone XR camera, a single 12 MP camera on a thinner phone gives much more plausible result.\nConsidering I haven't heard about it from any reviewer, I could be wrong, but I tested another Pixel 7 in store and it has the same issue. I blamed software but I'm now on the latest software. I blamed this mode that overlaps image from two cameras to make better results but it's almost equally as bad in 2x mode as it is on .7 mode.

What makes it worse is that my Pixel 1 did not exhibit this behaviour. This issue essentially renders the 5 unusable for night time photography. \nI have tried it in night mode, in regular mode as well as in videos. And the issue is just the same. \nIt is a massive let down, to buy the flagship phone from Google and yet encounter such issues. If I cannot use the phone at night without such issues, then I am not sure how I feel about staying with Google or the Android ecosystem.  Not sure what DxOMark are rating the camera on.\n\nHave others using Pixel 5 faced this issue, and if yes, any resolutions? \nIs this a hardware issue?\nAny support/resolutions from Google?",

But when playing back, the video has flashing/flickering, as if there were camera flashes at those moments. \n\nThis doesn't happen to every video, it's very random and it is not possible to anticipate. Only when the video is done recording, upon checking we realize that the footage cannot be used at all. All these would have jeopardize the memories we were suppose to capture. \n\n[Example](https://photos.app.goo.gl/t8SxajKK58M1XdgL7)\n(warning: flashing video lol) \n\nI've put together 4 videos, filmed across two occasions (22 March and 27 March 2025)\n\nDo you know what might cause this, and how to fix/prevent this? We can't even tell if this is a software/hardware issue :(\n\nWe had terrible experience with our old pixel many years back: electrical/wiring/static noise coming out of the phone within 6 months of using.

The camera would still work, but was still foggy/ blurry.\n\nThe next day (16th) the camera still worked. I put it in rice and left it in the sun (both of these for only 30-60mins each). I took a photo at 3:20pm, still blurry but working \n\nHowever, since 4/5pm (16th) my camera has not worked and shows the following error. Apps that use the camera (Snapchat, BeReal) won't work either.\n\n\n\n\nWhat Ive done:\nI have put my phone in rice overnight on the 16th and 17th. The condensation appears to be fully gone from the lens now.\nI have restarted/ powered off my phone multiple times\nI have cleared the cache and storage of the camera app\n\nAny advice would be much appreciated - thank you!!",

Now the file stays in both places and leaves what I'm going to call a \"ghost file\" in the original location.

When I open the camera app, I get just a black screen as shown in the picture attached, with a grey circle on the top left corner (see the arrow). No button works, and after a couple of seconds, I get an error message (second image).\n\nSo far I've tried:\nClearing cache\nClearing app data\nUnnstalling updates\nRe-installing updates\nRestarting in safe mode\nI've tried opening the camera after each step above, but the symptoms were the same. None of the above worked. The camera does not work with any other application either (ie. Whatsapp, etc).\n\nAny ideas? Could I have a hardware issue here?\n\nThanks in advance!",

Also when in low light areas the subject faces get \"blue paint\" on random spots of their faces. How can I stop this from happening. I have used all of the Pixel line when taking concert photos without an issue but this has been an issue in critical moments. Please see examples below.\n\nBelow is outside with normal street lights. Leon Bridges and my friends have \"Blue Paint\" on their faces. This is not even zoomed in. \n\n\n\nBelow is Olivia O'Brien talking on a stage without any concert lights.  This was before the show so she was sitting in white light talking to people. I zoomed in and the photos were all blue. \n\n\n\nI have many more examples but this only accepts so many attachments. I have been using other cameras because my photos have been very off from what I am used to with the Pixel line. Thank you so much for any assistance!",

    "user_question": "Hi, \nI bought my new pixel 5a a few days ago and everything was fine until I pointed my camera directly at a light. As you guys can see in the picture I get these vertical lines when I point the camera directly or even when the light is over my head. After I saw this I started googling about what is the problem and what I found is that it is not actually a problem, it just happens with all the devices, it has to do something with the LED lights flickering very fast. I even checked with other phones like oneplus' and apples' phones they all do the same thing. But the thing is my pixel phone does this a lot, like I don't even have to point the camera directly at the light, it showed the same lines when  I tried taking photo of a paper on my table and the light was over my head, this did not happen with the other phones. Also when those lines appear from a greater distance than any other phone I checked with, and it weirdly happens less when in video mode or even with ultra wide lens, like I have to be very close to the light for those lines to show up in video mode or while using the wide lens. Also oneplus' phone have this promode where if I set shutter speed properly I do not see this problem even when I am very close to the light. I want help from anyone who are good at photography, can you guys tell me ways to get around with it, like taking photos in some different mode, or is there something like promode even in my pixel phone? please help. Thank you.",

    "user_question": "I recently acquired a Pixel 8 Pro on a trip to Japan, I'm loving the phone but I'm having a small issue with the camera shutter sound. I understand there is a japanese law that requires camera shutter sounds when taking pictures or videos while in Japan. This is perfectly reasonable. \n\nHowever, I was led to believe that this was a geo-referenced restriction that would be lifted after I left Japan and inserted a SIM from a carrier from my own country (Brazil) where there is no such law. Would it be feasible to ask for an update that allows the camera shutter sounds to be turned off when outside of Japan?\n\nIn the Google Camera app settings FAQ it says \"in some countries, you can't turn off the shutter sound\". And that was fine in Japan where it is obligatory, but now I came back home where it's not and really would like the option to become available again.\n\nI have read other threads where people were able to reveal this option by removing their SIM, which sadly does not seem to be the case for me. I do understand this limitation when in Japan, but it doesn't make sense in countries without this legislation.\n\nI bought this phone for the long run, especially with the announced 7 years of updates, and would really appreciate an effort in resolving this matter, especially since the camera is one of the phone's biggest selling points.\n\nThank you for your time and I hope it is in your best interest to bring a solution to this matter.",

    "user_question": "When I make selfie I notice that my face always looks blurry and not clear comparing to the objects on backside - walls, furniture, stairs etc. I found it impossible to adjust focus distance so I suppose it is locked by background camera settings.\n\nSo I wonder is there any chance to correct this because it is very annoying. \n\nAnd in general it looks ridiculous to set the infinite focus length for front camera which is mainly used for selfies when objects (faces) are located at close range distance to the camera. \nI have attached sample photo, took in RAW and finished in Snapseed, to for more clear understanding. As you see - stairs on backside, located at 3 m from camera, are much more clear and focused better then my wife's face, located at 0,3-0,4 m from camera.\n\nPlease help to solve this problem.",

What happened. I am not sure. I only know that the thread below describes the experience I have had as well. It might be a low light issue....speculating.\n\nI just spent a good nearly 3 hours? with customer support and the best they could do was send me a new phone. Obviously, this will not solve the issue.  My wedding photos are now useless for prints, ranging from I think 0.8MP to 1.4MP, and a few actual 12.5MP dngs.

I know google will have an army of attorneys, and I may lose. But I have to try. I was sold a camera on its wonderful features, something that existed before, and now this. \n\nand...I have to deal with the fallout of my new wife and her disappointment. What is the cost of that?

I don't want anything more than a full refund so that I can go get a phone that will shot RAW just as I wanted it to. Looking for phone suggestions from all of you, if this is the case. I already have a Canon full frame DSLR, so please don't bother suggesting that. The POWER of the Pixel 3a XL was having RAW images captured with GREAT CONVENIENCE. That is all I expected of this \"Pro\" phone which is in no way shape or form PROFESSIONAL in any way. THAT, if anything is that worst part of their \"sales pitch\".\n\nThoughts, ideas?\n\n\n------\n\nStill no fix to useless RAW files?\nI recently purchased a Pixel 6 Pro.  So far, 1) I’ve discovering its terrible raw files, 2) found an old thread discussing the problem (https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/136090882?hl=en), and 3) confirmed with Pixel support that this is still intended operation of the camera (this step took 2 weeks).  \n\nGiven that it’s been nearly a year since that old thread was created, I’m posting this to see if anyone has discovered a work around.  If not, maybe this will help anyone who uses raw files for photography and has just stumbled across the same issue.\n\nThe Pixel 6 Pro has 3 lenses:  2.35mm, 6.88mm, and 19mm.  The user can apply a zoom ranging from .7x to 20x.  The camera then:\ndecides which of the 3 lenses to use,\ndigitally crops the image to somewhere between 12.5MP and .5MP, and\nuses software to resize the final jpeg back to 12.5MP.\n\nThis is normal for jpegs, but what I expected is that the raw file would always contain all the data hitting whichever sensor was used.  No cropping.  No compression.  If any digital zoom was applied, either by the photographer or by the camera software, the raw file would not be affected.  The jpeg matches what’s on the camera screen.  BUT the raw file matches whatever hits the sensor.\n\nFor some reason, the Pixel engineers have decided to do something different.  The raw file only contains the information that the cropped jpeg shows.  It matches whatever was on the camera screen when the shot is taken.\n\nWhat does this mean?  An uncropped photo taken on any of the lens produces a roughly 12MP raw file that’s about 11MB in size.  But if you zoom, say choosing the 2x, the raw file is now 4x smaller:  only the information from the zoomed sensor area shot is included.  So you get a 3MP file that’s under 3MB.\n\nWhere this is especially maddening is if you choose 4x zoom.  The user has no control over whether that setting uses the 19mm lens, or the 6.88mm lens with a 4x crop.  If the latter, the raw file is .7MP and less than 1MB; effectively useless.\n\nHas anyone found a workaround to this?    \nDetails\nCamera,Google Pixel 6 Pro\nLocked\nI have the same question (3)\nUnsubscribe\nCommunity content may not be verified or up-to-date.

When the phone's jpg isn't to my liking (the software's creative judgements and compression decisions aren't always perfect), I default to the raw file behind it.  And that raw file, when of sufficient size and quality, can be turned into really nice images.\n\nSince other camera makers seem to have solved the problem of delivering usable raw files, I was surprised that Google hadn't. I agree that if the intended use of the phone is jpeg-only, then expecting anything out of the raw files is silly.  But given what Samsung and Apple offer on the raw side,getting a 1MB file out of the Pixel 6 Pro looks more like a bug than a feature.\n\nNote that this isn't a knock on the quality of the jpegs.  Just that it seems reasonable to expect jpeg+raw to deliver something closer to what other high-end camera phones offer.\nLast edited Aug 27, 2022\nDetlef M.\nGold Product Expert\nI read manuals and void warranties\nAug 27, 2022\nI always felt that the raw function of Pixels was an afterthought that got implemented because users were demanding it, not because it was thought to be useful.\n\nThe only route to get something done is to send your suggestion via the Camera app > Settings > More settings > Send feedback.

Why do the RAW (DNG) files come out to be 1928 x 2560 when I import photos to my pc that I have taken on the 50MP resolution and RAW + JPEG  Pro photo settings.  I attached two images.  The left is a screenshot of the pixel 8 pro photo data and the right is the photo data from the PC.  As you can see the JPEG data matches what the pixel is saying to what the PC is saying. 50.1 MP / 6144 x 8160\nNow on the second image that shows the RAW info, the pixel is saying that the dng is 50.1 MP / 6144 x 8160 when on the right the pc data is telling me it's 1928 x 2560.  Doing the math that a 4.9 mp dng file which seems absurd.  The file sizes are roughly the same.  What gives?",

When focusing on a particularly beautiful array of pink clouds, the camera could not pick up what I was clearly seeing. The clouds and sky had an orange tint, were less defined, and the greenery below was dark and also less defined.\n\nI notice that sometimes the camera looks to fall short of accuracy in full daylight when I shoot, but then the algorithm seems to correct and the output is great.\n\nThis was not the case here, as shown in the first pic below.\n\nHOWEVER, I stumbled upon a short-term fix, which indicated to me that there is an issue that might be resolved. \n\nThat fix was to point the camera at the ground, then raise it quickly and snap a shot before it could focus and washout the picture. It was the photographer's equivalent of taking shots like a quick-drawing, Wild West cowboy in a shootout outside the saloon. Not the best scenario for making a composition, or much else.\n\nThree result was the second photo below, a pretty decent shot considering the quick, sweeping action I had to make to take it, and much truer to what my eyes saw.\n\nCan anyone steer me towards a fix so I don't have to act like a outlaw at the ok corral when I want to take pics at sunset?",

I have two smart TVs at home and plenty of other devices where my smartphone should be able to screen cast into, but every time I try it NOTHING shows up. This is stressing me out as I've already tried turning location off and on, restarting my phone, changing settings on the TVs and even looking up online guides, but nothing seems to work. Extremely weird behavior as my old phone (iPhone XS Max) which is 4 years older used to do this seemlesly and every time I opened the airplay function I had a myriad of devices popping up ready to receive its signal. What else can I try to connect to my LG smart TV? It shouldn't be this hard to set up such technology in 2022, specially on a flagship phone such as the Pixel, please help me out as I might be missing something!",

Could that be part of the problem?  Or could it be the Echo is maybe running on 4G and the wifi 5G? My router is dual 4/5G. My previous phone showed both and allowed me to  connect to either.  The pixel 6 pro doesn't.  I'm wondering if that has anything to do with it.  Should I  be using Bluetooth to connect to the Echo to my Wi-Fi?

The notification setting is still set as that as we speak but every time I receive a Visual VM now I get the default phone notification sound every time. I never had this problem with any Pixel phone until the last month or so. I've already tried changing to another sound in Visual VM & nothing changed. I also cleared the cache & even uninstalled the app & reinstalled it to no avail. Additionally, I've reset the network settings. I've also contacted my carrier (Verizon) to see if they have encountered this complaint from customers & they had no idea how to remedy it. Also, within the Phone App Visual Voicemail settings, everything is greyed out & doesn't allow me to toggle on/off. This is obviously an Android bug that has continued with the release of Android 15 that never existed before. You can clearly see on my screenshot that my notification sound for my visual voicemail is set a diff sound (Zen Success). I've already sent feedback a dozen times thru the Phone App & considering it's an ongoing issue they don't deem it important enough to remedy. Has anyone experienced this & know of a remedy?",

Because of this, the entire top portion of the phone can flex when moderate pressure is applied. The pressure is comparable to being in the front pocket of a pair of skinny jeans. My concern is the device could become compromised by this lack of structural integrity. I requested a replacement, and it was granted. However, I want to avoid being charged for the device if they deem it is not under warranty, so I'm looking for a third opinion. A Google rep told me this was not an issue they have had previous documentation of. However, looking through online forms did lead me to other users with a similar experience. Besides that, after reading the somewhat vague warranty on the device, it does state normal wear and tear is not covered under warranty. I believe this defect is no fault of my own, and this issue should not be considered normal wear and tear. But what I feel or believe is not relevant, so I'm hoping someone can clear the air for me. The device has no indication of an impact on the exterior and has been in a case 98 percent of the time I have owned it. Below is an image of what I am experiencing. let me disclose this is not my device as the condition of mine is not as severe, and I can not capture a clear image of the damage.

After looking around I managed to get into the phone info service using (*#*#4636#*#*) and I could see that the 'Mobile Radio Power' option was off, I turned it back on and nothing would happen, I then restarted my phone whilst it was on and then all was well. However, today when I try to turn on the mobile radio power, it toggles itself back off almost instantly or if there is a app switch/phone lock. I am now stuck with absolutely no connection to anything at all.\n\n I have also tried flashing the phone back to android 9 as I thought this could have fixed the issue however I get the same thing\n\nIf anyone could shed some light onto the problem i'd greatly appreciate it.\nDetails\nConnectivity, Network, Bluetooth,Google Pixel 3 XL",

Confirmed by security IT team. He has done this to all of my devices  and I'm now on my 9th android device within a short period of time (10months of hell) . He used to allow me to use my apps like normal (downloaded from his Google play store that is not able to show play protect certification but is a certified device) but when he gets really upset with me, he enjoys blocking access. For instance I'm on my 5th fiber modem installed with new wiring and new firewall etc and he has control over it already. Now, Google play is not loading and it gives the same error. I will attach. The other apps are all not recognizing that I am connected to wifi. I have tried mobile as well. Same errors... no network connection. There are several apks of his hundreds that he installed on all devices and he listens and watches me. He has even cloned the phone. What hope do I have?? And as a woman, this is very scary  and I want to know why there are not more resources and help out there. I've been working with police but small town with no resources. Then worked with fbi agent but she can't help without confirming he  has stolen from my bank account. Which he did, but it was cloned phone so it looks like me. So I didn't send that info yet because not sure it will work. He is currently pushing on keyboard closing it out and pushing this screen around b c 0 e    e    not going to let me finish Pease help  menm me. Will provide more information as needed I have collected a tremendous amount. And yes I know who it is I believe. And I've reported it but they don't have proof yet I guess???",

The reason I emphasize most is that there's two apps that are prominently used on my device that keep crashing after a bit of use. One of them is Amino. That one I can usually use just fine but it will crash after around a minute which is still a bit annoying and the other one is Kik whenever I'm using it I'll barely be able to send a message before the app crashes and kicks me out. I'm not really having any problems with any other apps so what's my thought process is is that these apps mainly use a bunch of ads and that maybe what's causing the problem and/or It may be the Android 13 update. But otherwise I'm pretty clueless. The only really hint I have is that every time they crash the message that pops up says Android services library has stopped working. Is there any way you can help me?",

I went through a lot of rabbit holes to try to fix it but at no avail. Here are some important facts for context \n\n1. When I check the security status from setting, it says that it has detected an unauthorized software. I've never changed anything in my phone and I only download the updated softwares from the official notifications I get\n\n2. I have cleared cache Google play multiple times\n\n3. On play store, it says my device is not certified. When I try to fix the issue it says it couldn't do it. Also in Google play it doesn't pass any integrity test\n\n4. I used to have a workprofile that has been removed now when I left my job. I read that it could maybe cause this error if some files are still there. I tried to trace any policy changes or any remaining apps but there's nothing there that i found\n\n5. I can use apps such as Samsung pass and banking apps but some random apps (like a game or a budgeting app) they give me the incompatibility issue\n\nIf anyone knows how I can fix it please let me know! It's so exhausting and I've been  trying to figure it out for months \n\nAnother possible solution im REALLY trying to avoid is factory reset as im afraid I'll lose my data when I do it",

Then, when I go to log in to Outlook app, I get an error message that says I need to choose a higher level of security in order to log into the MS Exchange authentication process.  However, no security certificates get presented... as if a popup is being blocked.  My company says it's a known issue with Google Pixel phones.  They say the app developer Airwatch is aware.

But it looks like if I have my VPN turned on, I will not be able to add a Google account (aka sign in), likely due to some restriction on Google's services framework.\n\nI have this suspicion because if I use NAT mode (not the Android VPN api) on my VPN apps, it would work (because then the system won't detect that I am using a VPN). Or if I use a router that connects to a VPN and it works as well.\n\nI also notice if I am on my VPN, I often fail to visit Google Docs (I can open the App but not the docs), Play Store (I can see new apps but the \"my app\" page is forever loading and no request is made from visiting this page - the VPN apps can see how many packets sent), and Youtube (also forever loading on homepage with no packet sent). If this happen, I must remove the Google account, delete storage on Google Play Store, Play Services, and Partner Setup and re-add my Google account to get them working again.\n\nThis is rather inconvenient. I think Google should consider removing restriction of VPN access particularly in areas such as China.",

At the current rate it is draining 1% battery every 2 minutes of not touching the phone at all. The phone is extremely hot and overheats within seconds of use. It only seems to charge when I turn off the phone, otherwise the battery continues to drain while charging the phone.\n\nThe circled blue parts are the crazy battery drain within a few hours. It doesn't seem like the apps are using up much of the battery. One day ago my battery life was extremely good and completely normal, please help!\nI have tried restarting my phone in safe mode, checking the app updates but nothing seems to work.\n\nThank you!",

Because pixel 3 xl support eSIM card, I download the eSIM card and active the service. Everything looks good. Until I use WellsFargo app in a ATM, I can't log in this app. I made sure signal is great, other apps including Youtube was working fast excep WellsFargo. First time I was mad with WellsFargo. I though WellsFargo's server was down.\nSoon after, I found App Line also didn't work in cell data connection.\nThen, again, I found if I use wifi, wellsfargo app works great. When I switch data, it never works.\nI call Sprint many times to figure out what problems. Sprint can't find anything.\n\nAfter two months' all kind of try, I know problem should be in the phone itself. Then I noticed I used eSIM card. This is the only different when I switched to Sprint. Then I looked for pixel phone support. Not surprised, like before, they insisted they are everything great. I need to talk to every app company to find the app problems. Google is always disappointed me every time now.\n\nFinally, I asked Sprint to send me a physical SIM card. I just got it and put it on. All problems go away.\n\nI never think Google will become a so terrible company. Google doesn't know how to make hardware and doesn't care any feedback from customer.\n\nMy Pixelbook also has problem they never care to fix .

When you write some digit suppose you write 10 it's written 100, then you have to move the cursor to the right position correct the digit and then add multiplication division or subtracting sign. Or when you open the app you have to adjust the cursor then you have to press the digits to use this app. This issue makes the app not user friendly and irritating. Previous Android versions have the calculator, you just open it type the numbers, press add subtract or division sign to get the answer but here you have to first make adjustments than use the app. Please use this app in Android15 and you will know what I am talking about. You will know why I am saying, this makes this app not user friendly in Android 15 and please adjusted as per previous Android versions. Please forward to the concerned department of Google Android if someone knows....",

Everything I take a picture of comes out looking like some bizarre abstract oil painting, everything looks plastic and nothing is in focus. This is the first time I've ever had issues with a smartphone camera. I've had pixels for several years now and never had this issue. I've searched for the last couple of years trying to find a way to fix this to no avail. The only thing I do find seems to be aimed at professional photographers, I'm just a Joe schmo who wants to point my camera and take pictures of my cats. I had a Samsung Note back in 2014 or so that I used to take pictures on a vacation to Europe as well as everything else for the 4 or 5 years that I had that phone. Every photo I took on that phone was fantastic, then I switched to pixel and I loved their phones and the pictures. Then when the new pixel 6 came out I decided to finally update my phone, and it's one of the biggest regrets I've ever had in purchasing a cell phone. I have spent hours and hours and hours trying to figure out how to fix this and at this point I just want to throw the phone in the trash and never buy a pixel again. Here is a sample photo that I took just today, this is about as good as it gets.",

Well, during the initial setup, a message appeared: Your device at work... I know questions like this come up a lot, but I have a question. Could this be related to the Google Fi app? Perhaps the seller himself installed it, and did not come out, did not delete it. The seller says he has no idea how it happened. But why didn't he reset it to factory settings then. Although there was nothing on the phone at all, it was clean except for Google Fi.So the phone belongs to an organization or is it blocked due to active Google Fi?\nI just want to understand, I was obviously sold such a phone or it happened by accident.

At first I was able to make it disappear by refreshing the apps in use, but opening them back up would cause it to come back. It stays like that now whether or not apps are running (tried running in safe mode as well and it wasn't any better). I've never had any display issues with this phone before and it was a very sudden change. It still works, but nothing can be viewed in the color intended.

It is fixed focused 10 feet behind the subject, even at the recommended distance of 18\" or more - the subject remains out of focus and blurry while the background is crisply in focus.\n\nHere's a test my professional video engineer dad ran on the 4a front-facing camera:\n\n\"The problem is a design or manufacturing fault.  Here are photos of the Pixel front facing camera as delivered and with a +2 or +3 close-up filter.  There are focus star charts at the subject distance of 14\" and also in the background at 9 feet.  As set at the factory the background is more or less in focus, but the subject is not.  It's better with a +2 close-up filter taped over the camera lens, and perfect with a +3 close-up filter.  Clearly the camera is not focused properly, either because the wrong focal length was spec'd or delivered for the camera, or because the lens is too close to the sensor.  The simplest fix for existing phones, under the circumstances, would be for Google to admit the camera has a fault, and send a small stick-on +3 close-up filter to place over the camera lens to anyone who requests one.\"\n\nStep up Google, and make good on your defective camera.",

I've recently found that I can use USB OTG with an OTG adapter and use a flash drive with my cell phone. I have a Samsung Galaxy A01 and my computer is a modified HP Slimline. I really hate sitting at a desk and staring at a screen and I would simply rather do everything on my cell phone, and that's what I've been doing all day. I have a 32 GB USB stick and I'm using chrome on my phone to download my executables, and then I move them over to the flash drive with My Files by Samsung, ultimately using the flash drive afterward to run that executable on my WIndows 11 PC. This has been going great, but my phone can't hold anything bigger than 3GB because it came with 16 and 13 of it is taken up by system programs I can't get rid and most of them are useless. Anyway, I'd like to download Skyrim Special Edition, which is like 20 GB - don't ask where I'm getting skyrim special edition for free and how I'm downloading from chrome. This is where the problem arises. My phone can't just download 20 GB and then dump it into a flash drive. I need it to be downloaded directly to the flash drive. The drive works perfectly fine to pass files back and forth. So I asked Google if there was a way for me to do that. Google said yes and I read several community notes where people have found their own work-arounds or bypasses for certain steps. My problem is this. I've done every single thing. I've put my phone into developer mode and changed the privileges so that chrome can access all of my storage, and so can Utorrent. The drive is formatted in FAT32 and I've been using it perfectly fine to move windows 11 compatible files from my android phone to my windows 11 computer. I've tried downloading all the apps that they say help with that. NOTHING. The picture below is the screen they keep telling me to go to to update the permissions. And this is where I'm  at a loss for words. Granting full access isn't even one of the options, and it should be, because my phone is rooted. I can move 30 GB of files or programs to this little USB stick with my phone, and i can even download directly to it with my PC. My phone refuses to give me the option to change my default download folder. Not on Chrome, not on Tor, and not on Utorrent. Where there's supposed to be an option for changing the default download folder, there are no options at all. Only \"close.\"",

I still do not have certification, what could be the reason for this?Also my girlfriend has the same model of phone and also a friend, but they normally have play protect certification. In addition, when checking I get this error, attached in the image",

    "user_question": "I have noticed my battery draining a lot faster since the end of last year. I went from charging my phone once every two days to sometimes needing to charge it twice a day. I don't think this is part of the Android 12 update issue. Recently it's gotten a bit annoying, so I tried factory resetting and only reinstalling apps I actively use, still no improvement. Looking at the battery usage report, the app called \"Google\" is consistently using up almost x3 the battery of my screen itself. I have no idea what his is, my brother who uses the Pixel 5 has it using less than 1% of total battery usage. I basically only use my phone to scroll social media or read web novels. \n\n\nThis is my battery usage report. The google app reads \"Total: 11 hours 59 minutes. Background: Less than 1 minute.\" If you look at the battery usage graph above, the last 2 hours where I was on my bed reading web novels used up more than 50% of my battery despite me literally only having google chrome open. That's less than 4 hours of continuous, low performance screen time. My old ASUS phone could do better than that.\n\n\nIn comparison, the screen apparently only used up 13% of the total battery while being on for 2 hours and 56 minutes. What is the google app doing in the background while I'm reading text off a web page that needs this much power?\n\n\nMeanwhile, this is my brother's battery usage report on his Pixel 5. Both of our phones are up to date running android 12, so this probably isn't an android 12 issue. My brother bought his pixel 5 sometime towards the end of last year, so his phone is a year newer than mine, but that doesn't explain the difference in app battery usage either. \n\nOther than factory resetting, I've tried turning on battery saver the entire day and restricting the battery usage of the google app, but neither of those make much of a difference. I still get like 4 hours of continuous screen time before my battery dies, and the google app still drains x3 the battery compared to the screen itself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

It seems to come from \"Phone Services\" and is started on bootup (based on the logs from adb) and held indefinitely.\n\nI've managed to figure out a few temporary workarounds:\nIf I am using a physical SIM:\nSwapping to the eSIM it will fix itself until the next reboot.\nTaking out the SIM, reboot, and then put the SIM back in it will fix itself until the next reboot.\nIf I am using an eSIM:\nSwapping to the physical SIM it will fix itself until the next reboot.\nDeleting the eSIM, reboot, and then downloading the eSIM will fix itself until the next reboot.\n\nIn general:\nIf no SIM (either physical or eSIM) is active when rebooting, then the wakelock won't persist.\nSwapping between SIM or eSIM fixes it without rebooting.\nBut, as soon as you reboot with one SIM active, the ProxyController wakelock stays active the entire time (longest I had it before attempting to fix it was 54 hours).\n\nCan anyone help on a more permanent solution? Obviously I can avoid rebooting, but I don't want to have to worry about a reboot causing a battery drain. Thanks!\n\nFor reference - I have the stock image, with the day one patch installed. I'm not a heavy app user, and tend to install very few apps from the default image.\n\nHere's an example of keeping it idle for ~4hrs, where the phone stays \"active\" the entire time with \"Phone Services\" taking up the entire held awake time:",

And where I live i get a million Spam SMSs a day and they all clutter up my conversation section. So ideally I just want Messages to be excluded as an app with access to Conversations.\n- Second, If you dismiss a notification you can't go back to the notification settings for that number and mark that conversation as \"not a conversation\" for Messages. \n\nDon't know if this is a problem with messages alone or all the notifications. Google could have worked a little harder on it's own products but of late they are turning into a disappointment.",

I am on the latest version of Gboard for August 2020.\n\nPlease see the attached screenshot. I have already tried disabling and re-enabling, as well as re-updating Gboard but the Kanji suggestions are still missing from the Gboard Japanese keyboard on my LG G8. This phone is on Android 9 and no OS updates are available.\n\nI have tried using the Google Japanese Input keyboard, and while Kanji suggestions work there, the English keyboard for it is difficult to use. If anyone has any suggestions on what I can do to fix Gboard Japanese conversion, your advice is greatly appreciated. I factory reset my device today so the OS itself shouldn't be a factor.",

Now I'm trying to get the USA model of pixel stand, GA00507-US, however, I couldn't find the power supply information about it. The Hertz between the US and Japan are different, one is 60Hz, the other is 50Hz. Actually, the west side of Japan is 60Hz, but I live in east side of Japan whose Hz is 50. If I bought the US model of pixel stand, can I use it in other countries whose Hz is 50 like Japan or other European area? Is something related to the Hz written in the instruction manual of the pixel stand of the US model? Please see the attached picture for your reference, in case of our country, the information of the Hz is described like the picture.",

Even if moving to another screen, the notification remains at the bottom of the screen. What makes it problematic is that it obscures the space bar (when typing in Messages) or other elements if onto a different screen. While I don't oppose the notification, the length of time it is on the screen is incredibly unhelpful. I have gone into Messages --> three dots --> settings --> notifications and turned off each toggle, retested, and cannot find the right setting to disable or reduce the length of time on the screen.\n\nTo get the screenshot below, I selected a message in Messages (click, long hold), the banner appeared. I clicked off the message, closed Messages, and moved to my home screen.  The banner I am inquiring about is the \"Message selected\" layered on top of my Google search bar on my home screen.",

How to check how the picker can close my google account. \n\nBecause from i read in android post. \n\"Expect to verify your ownership after factory reset\nTo factory reset a protected phone, you'll need to either unlock your screen or enter your Google Account password. This ensures that you or someone that you trust is doing the reset.\nExpect to unlock your screen or enter Google Account information if you:\nErase your phone's data using the Settings app:\nYou'll be asked to enter your screen lock before you reset.\nReset your phone using its buttons:\nIf you reset your phone using its buttons (Recovery mode), you'll need to enter your PIN, password or pattern. You'll also see an option to use the Google Account that was on your phone before you reset it.\nRemotely reset your phone with Find My Device:\nIf you remotely reset your phone using Find My Device, you'll need to enter a Google username and password associated with the phone.\nImportant: You can sign in with any Google Account previously added and synced to the phone as an account or user, but not as a guest. If you can't give this information during setup, you won't be able to use the phone at all after factory reset\"",

In particular:\nThe directory /Android/media/com.google.android.soundpicker has subdirectories Notifications and Ringtones that each contain 2-3 files with names of the form soundpicker_track_nnn.ogg. I suspect that these are the sounds currently selected in various applications. They are obviously not the full list of choices.\nThe directories /Notifications, /Ringtones, and /Android/data/com.google.android.soundpicker/cache are all empty.\nThe directory /Android/data/com.whatsapp contains nothing relevant, and I couldn't find corresponding directories for the other applications that have notifications set.",

I have received another update and installed it, however, the problem still persists. It changed the version to 14_C.10.\n\n2. when I click on any link which refers to an app, the option of \"always\" remains disabled. Moreover, the app icon is showing twice e.g, if I click on a news to open its link which refers to Chrome, two Chorme icon appears and the option of clicking \"always\" is disabled.\n\n3. Another issue I am facing is when ever I click on a link which is supposed to open another app e.g. Chrome, the Chrome app icon is shown double and the option of \"Always\" is disable and I am forced to choose \"just once\" repeatedly. \n\n4. The phone has got very slower after the update and the battery drains a little faster. \n\nI am from Pakistan and I  have sent an email to Realme support. They say this problem belongs to Android Software update. Few snapshots are attached.\n\nPlease help.",

If your phone has been dropped or damaged in any way, it's possible that the camera has been damaged as well. Inspect the camera lens for any cracks or scratches. If you see any physical damage, you'll need to take your phone to a repair shop.\nRestart your phone. A simple restart can often fix minor software glitches. To restart your phone, hold down the power button until you see the \"Power off\" menu. Then, tap \"Restart\".\nClear the camera app cache and data. This will reset the camera app to its default settings, which may fix the problem. To clear the camera app cache and data, go to Settings > Apps & notifications > See all apps > Camera > Storage & cache > Clear cache and Clear storage.\nCheck for updates. Make sure that your phone and the camera app are both up to date. To check for updates, go to Settings > System > System update.\nTry a different camera app. If you're still having problems, try downloading a different camera app from the Google Play Store. This will help you determine if the problem is with the camera app itself or with the hardware. (Snapchat, Instagram or WhatsApp)\nFactory reset your phone. If you've tried all of the above and you're still having problems, you can try factory resetting your phone. This will erase all of your data, so be sure to back up anything important before you do this. To factory reset your phone, go to Settings > System > Reset options > Erase all data (factory reset).",

Is this a software issue, or is this a hardware issue? How did Google not test these cameras out more, and why aren't there more people talking about this?\n\nEither way, this is super frustrating.

I have been unable to find any way to turn it off for this single app, so I have resorted to turning off the adaptive battery in its entirety in the hopes to make things run \"normally\". However, I was wondering if there was, in fact, a way to turn off the exclusion for that one app, specifically.

    "issue_type": "Wi-Fi Connectivity / Bluetooth",
    "user_question": "The ability of 5G NR networking appears to be \"bricked\" after short time in a 5G-SA network.\nIssue description\nIt seems that Google Pixel 6 (GB7N6) permanently looses the capability for 5G NR after a few successfull connections to a private (self-hosted) 5G-SA network (srsRAN project). The cause for this irrecoverable loss of functionality is unclear. The device stopped to find any 5G-SA networks in range, the activation of ENDC in public 5G-NSA network fails (device keeps connected only to LTE anchor while showing 5G sign).\nThe whole loss of functionality could be reproduced with a second device (same model). Now I have two Pixel 6 devices incapable of 5G NR.\nAttempts of recovery (without success)\nThe 5G capabilities could not be recovered by any of the following steps:\ndifferent SIM (both, private and public SIM)\nreset app \"SIM-Toolkit\"\nreset of network settings\npowercycle\ncomplete battery discharge\ntoggle supported RATs in hidden service menu *#*#4636#*#*\nupdate to beta of TQ2A\nupdate to stable TQ2A.230305.008.E1\nWhat I haven't tried is a full wipe of the device (aka factory reset), since this involves a lot of effort on personal devices. I'd try to avoid that if possible.\nIssue description\nI used a factory-new Pixel 6 with following software versions:\nAndroid version: 13\nSecurity update: Feb 5, 2023\nPlay system update: Oct 1, 2022\nBaseband version: g5123b-107485-221101-B-9242015\nKernel version: 5.12.107-android13-4-00020-g02b5dfab573c-ab9358130 #1 Thu Dec 1 18:28:18 UTC 2022\nBuild number: TQ1A.230205.002\nI put a test SIM with MCC/MNC 001/01 (IMSI 001010000051520) and connected to a private 5G-SA Network (using srsRAN project) in Band n3, 1842.5 MHz (NR-ARFCN 368500), see screenshot. The phone attached immediately and I was able to ping through the 5G-SA network, see screenshot.\nThen I disconnected the phone by shutting down the gNB base station.\nThe network search cleary listed numerous public 5G networks and also the private 5G testing network, see screenshot.\nAfter a few cycles, the phone suddenly lost the ability to find any 5G networks (neither private nor public).\nI repeated the same a few months later, using another Pixel 6. Again, the device attached, but after a few experiments, it also lost the ability to find 5G networks.\nIn the current state for both devices, the network search does not find any 5G networks (at the same location as before). As mentioned before, 5G-NSA does only use the LTE anchor cell, without any NR carrier.\nRequested feedback\nIs there any option to revive or unbrick the 5G capability (without a full wipe)?\nAre there any further hidden codes (like *#*#4636#*#*) to reset the modem into a functional state?\nBugreport\nPlease download bugreport here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sbRADq0cDFr2Q2GuAkYcvw9bLQ6JXMsb/view?usp=sharing\nPlease let me know if I can provide additional information on that issue.\nBest regards, Robert",

    "user_question": "For 10 hours of each day, the displayed time is 12 hours earlier than the correct time. A leading zero indicates AM, and is incorrect when the time is PM. Details follow:\n\nhttps://issuetracker.google.com/issues/260428002\n\nIn Android 12, the large two-line clock on the lock screen shows a leading zero on the hour between 1:00 and 9:59. During the afternoon and evening, this incorrectly indicates an AM time in military (24-hour) notation, for example 0100. The leading zero should be removed, particularly when the time is PM.\n\nWhat steps are needed to reproduce this issue?\n0. In the US locale, in Settings > System >  Date & time, be sure that Time format > \"Use locale default\" is enabled, so times will be displayed in the 12-hour AM/PM format.\n1. Use the power button to view the lock screen anytime between 1:00PM and 9:59PM.\n\nFrequency of occurrence?\nAlways.\n\nWhich Android build are you using?\nS3RHS32.20-42-10-2\n\nWhich device did you use to reproduce this issue?\nmoto g pure, hardware version PVT1, model XT2163-4\n\nPlease explain the issue in detail.\nSee attached screenshot, which I took at 1:24PM. The large two-line lock-screen clock is showing \"0124\", which means 1:24AM in military time or the 24-hour time format as used in hospitals, etc. This use of a leading zero is incorrect when the time is PM, as it incorrectly indicates AM. The leading zero before the hour number should be removed.\n\nAre you reporting this as Developer or User?\nBoth.\n\nScreenshot is attached.",

Uninstall all recent apps (always downloaded from playstore)\n2. Factory reset (twice already), but it comes back after a few days.\n3. I am sure that those apps i downloaded again from app store after hard reset, are safe because all other phones (office mates) does not have the same app, but we all somehow got the same malware.\n4. Eventually i found out what app creates the lock screen. then i did several things.\ni cleared cache, forced app to stop and uninstalled. (then after some hours, it installed itself)\ni cleared cache, forced app to stop and kept it that way, (lock screen again changed)\nafter some time, it changed its name. file name before was \"File Manager\" but with an android icon.\nthen now it became \"Skin\" with  the android icon\nI tried installing, malwarebytes, bitdefender, avast, avg, kaspersky, norton.. but none of them blocked the app from reinstalling itself.\ni also tried scanning with all of them when i save the \"app\" has been installed again.\ni disabled all privileges that the app had! ( it got me worried to seeing this!)\nWhat I know:\n1. It install by itself only thru internet. when my data is off it cant re install itself.\n2. It drains my battery fast, because it uses data in the background.\n3. It can change its name. with the same logo for the lock screen (sometimes icon is a \"gift box\"\n4. it has made itself a lot of permissions. please see my photos.\n\ncan anyone please help me remove this malware? its aimed toward hacking people. it can access all your files! \n thanks in advance!",

Handy little problem comes along and after a short while you will have a useless phone that eventually will stop working.\nHell I have even been checking out the phones on the Google store in preparation for my replacement 4xl's untimely death.\n\nOn the plus side the phone has worked great, I have enjoyed it.....\nBut this phone like the one that was replaced will not have a death from natural causes (like that time you drop it and smash the screen for good, or even normal battery degradation and eventually just to become so slow in the future it's utterly useless ((like my Nexus 6))\n\nWould have been nice for the kids to have for a while till they smash it, or as a spare phone etc....etc.....\n\nI guess if my replacement refurbished pixel 4xl had broken down within the extended warranty it would have been replaced with another 4xl awaiting the same fate!  ( Warranty ran out in August so it missed that one but has brought me this lovely Christmas gift...... That LOVELY ? of unknown battery!\n\nThanks Google happy Christmas and a problem reading battery meter to you too!\n\nPs I have been GOOD so PLEASE send me a replacement phone that's not a 4xl or just come clean about the fix for this perfectly good ( planned in obsolescence ) phone.\nI personally think it's software!\n\nI'm not expecting any experts to send me off in the direction of the post that are on this forum, but actually explain what on earth is the cause of this problem.\n\nSo happy\n\nJames",

I have no idea why this happens - I'm constantly checking my keyboard settings to see if it's somehow switched autocorrect back on but it always says it's off - there are no other relevant settings I can choose, as even trying to turn things like the suggestion bar off doesn't fix it. As you can imagine, its driving me up the wall, so if anyone has any idea what's going on, I'd greatly appreciate the help!\n\nEdit: remembered to include a screenshot of my settings.",

    "user_question": "I am facing a persistent and very frustrating issue on my Android device and I'm hoping someone here can offer some guidance.\n\nThe Problem:\nFor the past few days, I have been constantly receiving an \"Account action required\" notification from Google Play Services for all three of my Google accounts signed into the device. Tapping the notification prompts me to verify my accounts.\n\nWhat I Have Already Tried:\nI have gone through almost all the standard troubleshooting procedures multiple times, but the problem always returns after a few hours. Here is a detailed list of the steps I've taken:\n\nPassword Verification: I have verified my accounts by entering the correct passwords multiple times. The notifications disappear temporarily but always come back.\n\nClearing Cache: I have cleared the cache for both \"Google Play Services\" and the \"Google Play Store.\" This did not solve the issue.\n\nClearing Storage/Data: I took the more drastic step of using the \"Clear Storage\" (or \"Clear All Data\") option for Google Play Services.\n\nRe-adding Accounts: After clearing the storage, I removed all of my Google accounts from the device.\n\nRebooting: I then restarted my phone.\n\nSigning In Again: After the reboot, I signed back into each of my Google accounts one by one.\n\nThe phone works perfectly for a few hours after these steps, but then, inevitably, the same \"Account action required\" notifications reappear for all accounts, forcing me to verify them again in the Play Store, Chrome, etc. I have gone through this entire cycle four times now. I also occasionally get a \"Your data isn't backed up. Add a backup account now\" notification alongside this issue. But the issue (\"Your data isn't backed up. Add a backup account now\") hasn't come up since I turned off backup.\n\nDevice: Walton Walpad 8g\nAndroid Version: 11\n\nThis issue is becoming extremely disruptive. Since I have already tried all the common solutions, I suspect this might be a more complex bug, a server-side issue, or a deeper account-syncing problem that I can't resolve from my end.\n\n[I have added two screenshots of this issue].",

December 2020 I stopped being able to download updates for a couple apps (including Netflix) due to lack of compatibility. I didn't think much of it because I was still able to access the versions I had installed. \n\nNow that the weather is better I went to play Pokemon Go but ran into a compatibility issue after logging in. After digging around a bit I found out that rooted devices and custom rom could cause the \"SafetyNet\" check to fail, as well as certain apps. I downloaded something to check safetynet, and the phone is failing the cts profilematch and basicintegrity. Further searching said it could fall if the play protect certification was missing as well.\n\nI don't have a rooted phone and I don't have any custom ROM. I have a few cloned apps (not pokemon go) and had an app manager, but i have since deleted these and it's still failing -- and I had them installed for a long time with no issues besides. I turned off developer options and to my knowledge I don't have an unlocked bootloader, though I'm not 100% sure what that is. \n\nGoogle Play doesn't list the certification status where it says that it should, and right now that's my only lead.\n\nDoes anyone know of a tool that can pinpoint the reason for safetynet check failure, or know how to further troubleshoot this? Usually I'm pretty good at googling this kind of stuff, but everything I'm pulling up is for people having problems with rooted phones which isn't applicable. \n\nAny help or insight would be appreciated!",

Switch app background battery usage from \"Optimizing\" to \"Not Optimized\"\n1. Try a variety of apps. They all exhibit these symptoms.\n\nUnanswered mysteries:\n\n1. How does \"Adaptive Battery\" (settings/battery/adaptive battery) interact with \"Not Optimizing\" background battery? (Settings/Apps & Settings/*App name*/Advanced/Battery/Battery Optimization)\n1. If I whitelist an app in Background Battery  usage, will it still get stopped by Adaptive Battery?\n1. Can gaps in location data be caused by an unreliable GPS signal? (For example, between city buildings, or in a forested area).\n\nMy next steps:\n\n1. Test apps in optimal GPS conditions (clear sky, no trees, etc.)\n1. Test each app systematically\n1. Test apps with adaptive battery turned off\n1. Test apps with all battery optimization turned off in developer settings\n\nExamples of some apps being tried: GPSlogger, OSMAnd+, Hiking Project, MTB Project, Open Tracks, GaiaGPS\n\nPlease let me know if you know how any of this works, or have suggestions for what to try.

    "user_question": "Wow, WHAT a pathetic service from Google. I thought it was happening with me only. But after seeing many posts such as this one, now I rest assured that Google's quality of phone and service is really deteriorating. I'm a Google phone user since the Nexus Era but now Google doesn't even want to listen to their customers. So, I decided to write down this post. \n\nI'm having a lot of issues with my a year-old Pixel 2 xl (like discharging in 2 to 3 hrs, bottom speaker turns off automatically and I have to restart my phone, phone hangs (though very rarely), etc, and from my worst experience of the service of Pixel 1, I never bothered to contact the service center because I knew they are no help nowadays) but I called the customer care today to check the price of a part that needs to be replaced.  I just dropped my phone on a wooden floor that too not from a very great height, and my phone's screen got shattered like a delicate piece of a glass toy. Is it really a tough gorilla glass? Anyways, I asked the support guy to tell me the price of the new glass but he wants me to hand over my phone to the courier service of the support team for diagnosis. Really? You can't just tell me the price of the part? Not even a simple estimation? My touch screen is good and responding well, I just need to know the price of top glass so I can decide whether it is worth changing. If Google doesn't change just the top glass and If I have to change the entire display (touchscreen + glass) then tell me the price accordingly. Please, just to know the price of the top glass don't make me wait for days. If the hardware support team cannot tell me this simple thing then why they are even there? Seriously, Are you for real?\n\nFrom original Nexus to Nexus 5 to Nexus 6 to Pixel 1 and Pixel 2 Xl, My experience of Google phones is going from Wow to WHAT!!. I guess it's time to change the phone to some other good brand like Apple, at least their service is best in the class and they listen to their customers. Google charges a lot for their phones and its customer loves Google phone but Google should love its customers too. It's sad to see the quality of hardware and the service response from my beloved phone's manufacturer.",

    "user_question": "My phone battery died went to 0% after using it all day. When I went home to charge last night, instead ofgiving me the \"battery charging\" page, it gave me the Recovery Mode Page. Now, I can't get out of it even when I select \"Reboot\" or \"Power off\". I don't know why it's giving me this message or how to fix it.\n\nHere's what happens...\n\n>>>When I first plug it in, it doesn't give me the battery charging page. It gives me the recover page and tells me \"# Reboot Recovery Cause is [system_server:13301 RecoverySystemRescueParty]# Supported API: 3 # MANUAL MODE v1.0.0# Unable lacking storage boot warning !! (Image 1.A and 1.B below)\n\n>>> Then, when it gives me a handful of options to \"reboot system now, reboot to loader....power off, etc.\" (Image 1.A and 1.B below)\n\n>>> When I select \"Reboot\" or \"power off\" from that page, instead of powering off, it tries to restart but can't, and then gives me this message...\n\"Your phone couldn't start normally. Some configuration data may be corrupt [....] follow the instructions below (Try again, erase app data, visit service center). # Reboot Recovery Cause is [system_server:13301 RecoverySystemRescueParty] # Reason is [RescueParty]# Supported API: 3 (Image 2.A & 2.B below)\n\n>>> I select Try Again or Power Off and it brings me back to that original page. (Image 1.A and 1.B below)\nMy internal storage was near full, so I got a new SD card to transfer things over but didn't get to do that before this happened. I replaced my SD card after getting this message and it still hasn't fixed it. No matter how long I leave it unplugged to give it a rest and let think about its life choices, my phone will still turn on with this Recovery Mode attitude when I plug it in to charge, rather than the batter charging page. xD\n\nObviously, I want to avoid factory reset or erasing all app data. I contacted Samsung chat and they redirected me to a service center, the closest to me being 1.5 hours away. Obviously, I'd like to find a closer, easier option. Haha. Any suggestions here?

Then I accidentally quit YouTube, because I was expecting to close Chrome instead when I swiped up. This happens every time - I touch the recent apps button, and instead of the current app zooming out and appearing on the center of the screen as it normally should, I switch back to the previous app. It may seem like an unimportant issue, but it's seriously ruining my experience, and I can't seem to find a solution just yet.\n\nI tend to run several apps at once when I'm using my phone, and I get really annoyed when this happens. I searched my entire settings menu, but wasn't able to find an option to turn this off so that I see my current app on the center of my screen when I touch the recents button, not the previous one. Am I missing something? Is there a way to fix this so that I stop accidentally closing the apps that I don't intend to? Thank you in advance.\n\nMy Android version is Pie (my software is up to date) and my phone model is Huawei P30 Lite, if that helps.",

    "user_question": "Hello Guys, \n\nI'm experienced some pathetic issue of Fingerprint Sensor in my pixel 6a after updating to stable build of Android 13.\nFingerprint Sensor was working really great in Android 12, but after updating to Android13 two issues I'm facing,\n\n1) Not able to unlock using fingerprint. None of the registered fingerprints have recognised. Very rarely it unlocks after trying like 20 to 30 times.. \n\n2) so I removed the exiting registered fingerprint to register new fingerprint to fix the issue, but again faced such pathetic issue, here it's not able to register only not even once. It's consistently failing like anything. (Have attached the screenshot for reference).\n\n3) I tried contacting Google One Support and I explained the exact issue I'm facing, they adviced me to factory reset phone to fix this issue, I have followed and did reset n tried. But results are the same. Still it got worsen to register fingerprint during initial setup as well post setup.\n\nThis is very annoying bug while everything works super smooth without any issues but crippled fingerprint sensor which is the main security failure in Pixel 6a devices. \n\n\nI REQUEST GOOGLE TO PLS CHECK THIS BIG AND FIX THE ISSUE. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE EXPECTED FROM A TRUSTWORTHY BRAND LIKE GOOGLE. PLESE RECTIFY THIS ISSUE AND FIX IT. \n\nPls help me if anyone faced similar issue and get me rid of this problem.",

I have talked to Mint Customer Service several times and they do not seem to know what IMS registration status means.\n\nI have worked with Samsung (doesnt seem to be a hardware issue) and Mint without any resolution. Mint thinks its an Android issue since it happened right after the Android security update pushed out and they suggest waiting for another update to fix it or getting a different phone. The December Android update was applied to my phone and nothing changed.\n\nWhat I have all tried:\n-Reset Network Settings/multiple APNs\n-New SIM card from Mint\n-Factory reset of phone\n-Samsung software reflash\n\nIs this an Android issue or do I need to work with my carrier on the IMS registration status?",

    "user_question": "Here we are again, a few months ago my phone was left in the car on a particular warm day. The phone went into cool down mode. No big deal. Just a little warm for a few minutes. I then realized my Face unlock would not work. So I deleted the saved face and was unable to add a new one.said \"Enrollment not successful\". So I did a factory reset and nothing. Contacted Google. They suggested a repair or a replacement. However I use my phone for work so I cannot just send it off without a replacement in hand. Also if I choose to replace it, I would get a refurbished one with no warranty. Really disappointed. I'm mad actually. I spend a good portion of my money for a reliable phone and it's proven to be u reliable and customer service is horrible to deal with. After a few months another update came out and it suddenly started working again. Great! Except it only last for a couple of days. Then a day later, nothing worked. Did a factory reset and installed updates and it started working again up until now. Suddenly stopped working again. I refuse to get a refurbished phone. I believe that is unfair since I paid full price for a new one. Pre-ordered in October. I'm just tired of the issues. And don't want to deal with Google again. Any suggestions on what to do? I know there was some issues earlier in the year with a update, but no other post have been made since then.",

    "user_question": "Just had this email come through to my spam, I've reported it and I'm just curious if anyone else has received this email too.\n\nGreetings!\n\n \nI have to share bad news with you. Approximately a few months ago, I gained access to your devices, which you use for internet browsing. After that, I have started tracking your internet activities.\n\n \nHere is the sequence of events:\n\n\nSome time ago, I purchased access to email accounts from hackers (nowadays, it is quite simple to buy it online). I have easily managed to log in to your email account\n\n \nOne week later, I have already installed the Cobalt Strike \"Beacon\" on the Operating Systems of all the devices you use to access your email. It was not hard at all (since you were following the links from your inbox emails). All ingenious is simple. :).\n\n \nThis software provides me with access to all your devices controllers (e.g., your microphone, video camera, and keyboard).\nI have downloaded all your information, data, photos, videos, documents, files, web browsing history to my servers. I have access to all your messengers, social networks, emails, chat history, and contacts list.\n\n \nMy virus continuously refreshes the signatures (it is driver-based) and hence remains invisible for antivirus software. Likewise, I guess by now you understand why I have stayed undetected until this letter.\n\n \nWhile gathering information about you, i have discovered that you are a big fan of adult websites. You love visiting porn websites and watching exciting videos while enduring an enormous amount of pleasure. Well, i have managed to record a number of your dirty scenes and montaged a few videos, which show how you masturbate and reach orgasms.\n\n \nIf you have doubts, I can make a few clicks of my mouse, and all your videos will be shared with your friends, colleagues, and relatives. Considering the specificity of the videos you like to watch (you perfectly know what I mean), it will cause a real catastrophe for you.\n\n\nI also have no issue at all with making them available for public access (leaked and exposed all data).\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): Under the rules of the law, you face a heavy fine or arrest.\nI guess you don't want that to happen.\n\n \nLet's settle it this way:\n\n\nYou transfer 6.6 Bitcoin to me and once the transfer is received, I will delete all this dirty stuff right away. After that, we will forget about each other. I also promise to deactivate and delete all the harmful software from your devices. Trust me. I keep my word.\n\n \nThat is a fair deal, and the price is relatively low, considering that I have been checking out your profile and traffic for some time by now. If you don't know how to purchase and transfer Bitcoin - you can use any modern search engine.\n\n \nYou need to send that amount here Bitcoin wallet:\nbc1qnwah4fzrnf79vuzk5hc9kwmlxkyuuau7v7zj6p\n\n \n(The price is not negotiable).\nYou have 5 days in order to make the payment from the moment you opened this email.\n\n \nDo not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data is already uploaded to a remote server).\nDo not try to contact me. Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either, since your data is already on a remote server.\n\n \nThis is an APT Hacking Group. Don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work.\nI will monitor your every move until I get paid.\nIf you keep your end of the agreement, you won't hear from me ever again.\n\n \nEverything will be done fairly!\nOne more thing. Don't get caught in similar kinds of situations anymore in the future!\nMy advice: keep changing all your passwords frequently.",

    "user_question": "My phone is a Pixel 7 Pro unlocked model GE2AE. I brought it from US and I'm trying to understand why it doesn't work in Rio de Janeiro neither with Claro or TIM operators under de 5G coverage area. When I first arrived the phone connected to 4G. So I changed my plan to 5G and received 2 SIMs: 1 e-SIM and 1 physical. With the phone properly set to 5G the e-SIM only connects to 3G, even changing to a new one. Then we tried with the new physical SIM and it connected only in 4G. Using the same chip on an Apple 5G iPhone, at the same spot, the network immediately connected to 5G with more than 800mbps speed, suggesting we had the new 5G Stand Alone network running. The operators technical team after been amazed with this new Pixel model on hands, they tried unsuccessfully use different possible APNs. Some days later, a network engineer from another operator (TIM) tried his 5G chip on my phone. His was on 5G, but the 7 Pro only got 4G. I have made my homework and saw that GE2AE model specifications match the SA 3.5GHz as well as the DSS 2.3GHz and many of their \"N\" bands. Although the official Google Pixel do not mention Brazil's 5G networks as compatible, specially here in Rio de Janeiro specs seem to match, as the city is one of the first to have SA antennas coverage and a lot more DSS. I have been using it for a month and never saw the so much expected 5G symbol appear at the top of my screen. All that said, any expert good soul knows:\n1. Why would e-SIM only connect to 3G while the physical chip connects to 4G?\n2. Should I expect this phone to be compatible with local 5G network one day or would it be better to change to Samsung S22 which is already fully compatible?",

Unfortunately Apps are always placed in order from top to bottom on both the home screen and also on folder views. That makes it hard to reach Icons in general. Also it isn't possible to change the default ordering from left to right to it's inverse from right to left. If I would be a lefty that would be okay but nothing for a right handed person. please consider my attached screenshot and the dilemma of having a hard time to reach icons in the expanded easy access group. There's a lot of non reachable area.\n\nTherefore it would be great to have the two options in the settings to let the layout automatically spread the app Icons vertically and horizontally based on user preference:\n- spread icons vertically: top to bottom || bottom to top\n- spread icons horizontally: left to right || right to left\n\nAlso it always interferes with manual placements. Cause most times I rearrange icons due to most recently used on the bottom right corners if possible. \n\nI hope my concerns are somewhat understandable and not too difficult to implement.",

It seems I was in the wrong section despite the fact that I was talking about Google Voice.\nAnyway, it used to be a grey screen with a green  button in the middle. This morning it looks different, white screen with a bigger blue button and it works worse.\nI did nothing to my cell, no firmware updates, no new apps... just regular download of the app update from Google Play Store.\n\nIt seems I am not the only one with this problem:\n\nhttps://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S20/Google-Voice-Typing-suddenly-different/td-p/1679434\n\nAny idea, please?",

For example Japanese, Korean,Simplified Chinese,Traditional Chinese those are only have one weight of font and that means when apps need bold weight font, the system will calculate a fake bold weight for that and some times even no fake bold for that but use normal weight.\nThe fake one is not reading-friendly and beautiful at all.\nSo l hope you guys can make full weight font come true.\nHere comes compares.\nThe fake bold one is shoot on Pixel 4 and the true bold one is shoot on Htc 10 which using magisk module to make it come true.",

I could use my phone heavily all day and not run out of battery.\n\nThis all occurred after I updated my phone, with what I now understand to have been a problematic update. I did the update right before leaving Canada for a trip.

I've updated everything available to me via system updates and play store. Please help.\n\nAlso see below screenshot of my battery usage, which is maybe not accurately capturing the battery?

No I did not back the photos up with any service and no they are not on an sd card.\n\nI used to do a lot of modding on phones not long ago, I had a galaxy s3 and an htc desire 626. If there is some custom bootloader or firmware I can install that can read the data off my phone Im all down for it, none of my data is encrypted and as you can tell I could care less if the phone breaks. I just cant afford to take it to a shop. If i did, anyone have an idea of the price.\n\nThe reason I cant get the photos off is because my screen is damaged to the point where if i turn the phone on it starts touching random things in every place, a lot of times opening the emergency dialpad, which scares me.\nI've tried usb OTG cable with keyboard and mouse, I can get my password in with the keyboard if i do it fast enough but besides that the broken touch sensors just go insane after that, usb debugging has been disabled by default cause I would just turn on file transfer anytime I needed to do something on my pc with my phone.\n\nWhat I am asking you is how can I get my photos off my phone. I cant use usb otg and I cant pay a professional. If needed and if someone had some I could put custom firmware on the phone or root the damned thing, anything to get those pictures. They are not backed up anywhere and are only stored on the phones internal hard drive. If it really comes down to it, Ill melt the glass glue off myself and figure out how to rip data off of the hard drive raw. which would suck i presume.\n\nI have a nice windows desktop that I can install some apps on if needed, and I really do appreciate ALL the help you guys have to offer.\n\nThanks for checking in to this post and hopefully I can get my photos!\n\nQuick youtube shorts I uploaded so you can get a jist of the \"Ghost Touch\"\n\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/SwRTeNs8C9E?feature=share\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/gmWKnfJrqsU?feature=share\n\nhttps://youtube.com/shorts/U7-XDZX1VCw?feature=share",

So a massive backlog of updates queued up behind it.\n\nLet me know if that doesn't sound right ...\n\nMy problem now after deleting lots of redundant apps is that I am stuck in a loop where the phone takes all day to download the updates it's listed as pending, only to refresh the list and mark them all as still needing further updates. See attached screen shot. \n\nThis has been going on for a week.\n\nWeirdly, although the smallish downloads take ages for each app, I can connect to the phone as a mobile hotspot and download updates to my MAC in reasonable time. e.g. minutes not hours.\n\nI've tried following the advice in the sticky on this forum about pending updates but now seem to have succeeded in being stuck pending with no downloads happening. Specifically clearing the cache and data in the download manager.\n\nCan anyone suggest why just the pending updates for my apps are so slow to download over 4G while the rest of the phone is fine? \n\nMy system info:\n\nAndroid Version - 9\nBaseband Version - N950FXXSEDTL1\nKernel Version - 4.4.111-19523767",

Although there seems to be some way to use Chrome Extensions by installing other internet browsers (ex. Kiwi Browser), but I wish my service be accessed by any type of mobile web browser using OS functions.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

    "user_question": "Hello, I have this issue that would really require resolving regarding WhatsApp backup. So I have a basic Google Account with 15 GB of space, but my family member has a family package in OneDrive that is sharing 1 TB of cloud storage there with me and my primary email adress is set to be my gmail adress and it is connected to my microsoft profile so I should be having 1 TB of space instead of 15. When I open my OneDrive, my account lists my gmail adress and cloud storage of 1 TB, but when I try to upload my backup on WhatsApp it says my storage is full (15 GB). However, in my whatsapp settings, I can't have any backup email adress except the one from Google, but then why it ignores the 1 TB of storage which is tied to my gmail adress? I searhed the internet and a lot of people said that you can use your OneDrive to store your whatsapp backup, either directly to OneDrive or tgrough a connected gmail adress. Some tutorials I found are telling me to press some settings options in my whatsapp to switch to OneDrive which I do not have displayed as options. Does anyone have an advice relating to this issue or has had a similar problem before? For reference I use a huawei p30 pro so I even included that in my search for solutions but it doesn't make any difference. I don't want to pay extra space for Google One when I already have a TB of space on OneDrive, especially since I can see on the internet and some other posts that it is possible for people to use OneDrive as backup storage for WhatsApp.\nThe images represent everything mentioned abive from guides to storage shown in Whatsapp and OneDrive.",

When contacting Google support (from Google One to Google Store to Google Help Center) and following the troubleshooting steps they recommended finally I was asked to request a repair.  I must note that this issue originally started like 3 day after purchase, that time I restarted in safe mode, updated to the December features drop and rebooted, suddenly everything seemed to be corrected. 2 or 3 days later it happened again, I flashed the phone several times as it would allow to pass the configuration screen from time to time, something weird happened one time: when you are asked to press the edged to test the assistant I tried doing it with no answer, as if some sensor or the assistant software were failing\n\nI followed other recommendations I found over the internet for Pixel issues as trying to install other keyboards, disable face recognition and any pin/pattern for security, preventing the phone updating any app or the software itself, with SIM, without SIM, fully charged, connected to a PC, connected to the (of course original) charger, turning off ambient EQ and the 90hz refresh rate, without success so finally I gave up and requested the repair (7-10 days as no close by repair site was available), I want to emphasize that nothing has happened with the device: no drops, no water nor humidity, nothing more than regular use.\n\nHas anyone went through something like this (either the failure or the repair process)?\n\nAndroid 10\nBuild Number QQ1B.191205.012.A1\n\nAny advise will be appreciated",

And I was super happy about it at the beginning. \n\nHowever, over the course of time, the quality of images from the front camera has reduced drastically. It's not like the phone is taking bad pictures; it looks more like a focus issue.\n\nSince the camera used to take splendid images earlier, I feel it is a software issue rather than anything to do with the hardware. Just look at the attached image, the one on the right was taken the very next day I bought the phone while the one on left was taken today. \n\nI understood that I'm not the only one facing the issue as couple of my friends who own the phone also told me the same. There are also numerous posts about it in this forum too. And if we google it, you can see a lot of people have the same issue.\n\nWould really love it if Google can do something about the front cam software as I know my device can take better selfies",

Every single time I have do the 3 step process to start the charging. \n1. Though it's a C-type cable, it doesn't work if I change the position. So i marked it and used it like USB cable, meaning if the marked part going downwards  , it won't bother to start charging whatever I do for next steps.\n\n2. Need to click on the silent notification. Which is \"android system: Charging connected devices via USB\"\n3. Select this device, then starts charging.\n\n, Sometimes I go to USB preferences to switch it to \"charge connected devices\", but didn't bother to change.\n\nI noticed so many people are facing this. Still Google never try to resolve this. And stop saying rebooting in safe mode, after the new android update, there's no option of that. It just restarts and still same issue.\n\nN.B. I bought this phone from Singapore, currently stuck in pathetic country Malaysia due to pandemic.",

    "user_question": "Hello, \nSince the recent update that merged Google's Nearby Share and Samsung's Quick Share, I've been facing a persistent issue that prevents me from sharing files from my Android phone to my Windows PC.\nThe Problem:\nWhen I try to share any file, Quick Share on my phone now requires me to \"Turn off Wi-Fi hotspot\" before it will search for devices. My laptop is normally connected to this hotspot for internet.\nThe main issue is that after I follow the prompt and turn off the hotspot, my phone gets permanently stuck on the \"Looking for nearby devices...\" screen and is never able to find my Windows PC.\nDuring this time, my PC has the Quick Share application open and running, its visibility is correctly set to \"Receive from everyone,\" and both its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are enabled. The feature is simply not working anymore. This feels like a significant step back, as the previous Nearby Share was more seamless.\nDevice Information:\nSending Device: mobile - POCO X 7 ( Android 15 )\nReceiving Device: ASUS TUF A17 ( Windows 11 )\nApp Versions: I am running the latest version of Quick Share on both my phone and my Windows PC.\nTroubleshooting Steps I Have Already Taken:\nI have tried all the standard troubleshooting steps multiple times without success:\nConfirmed visibility on the PC is set to \"Everyone\" and toggled it off and on.\nTurned Bluetooth off and then on again on both the phone and the PC.\nEnsured the devices are physically right next to each other.\nChecked Windows Defender Firewall and confirmed that \"Quick Share\" is allowed for both Private and Public networks.\nCompletely uninstalled and reinstalled the Quick Share application on my PC.\nRestarted both my phone and my PC.\nDespite all these steps, the discovery process fails every time.\nIs this a known bug with the new Quick Share update? Are there any other solutions or workarounds to get my devices to connect again?\nThank you for your help.",
